Some claim the best specialty coffee beans come from the highest coffee-growing regions in the world. But the best coffee for you depends on your personal preferences: what kind of coffee you like and what flavor notes you prefer. 

## Below 3,000 Feet: Low Altitude

Coffee that grows below 3,000 feet tends to taste mild and soft with more subtle and earthy flavors than high altitude coffees. As we mentioned already, Robusta coffees grow abundantly at 600-2,500 feet elevation. Unlike Arabica plants, hardy Robusta plants can handle higher temperatures and ward off pests. However, the coffee tastes harsher and more bitter. Some describe it as rubbery, earthy, or muddy. Because of this, it’s typically used as a filler in coffee blends or as espresso or instant coffee. 

Arabica coffee plants are more fragile and grow best in cooler subtropical environments with rich soil and moisture. An example of lower altitude Arabica coffee is Hawaiian Kona, developed in the Kona Coffee Belt between 600-3,200 feet elevation. Hawaii has unique growing conditions, with quality coffee trees planted along volcanic slopes.

## 3,000-4,000 Feet: Medium Altitude

Coffee that grows at an altitude between 3,000 and 4,000 feet can taste sweet, smooth, and a little more acidic than lower elevation coffees. You’ll start noticing more nuttiness in coffee falling in this range. Regions that grow coffee at this medium altitude include Santos, India, and Brazil. 

## 4,000-5,000 Feet: High Altitude

Once you get up to 5,000 feet in elevation, you’ll notice more pronounced citrus, vanilla, and chocolate or cocoa notes. You can get coffees from Costa Rica, Indonesia, Flores, and Mexico from this high elevation range.

## Above 5,000 Feet: Very High Altitude

Beans that grow above 5,000 feet will be much more acidic and complex and produce coffees with floral, fruit, spice, and wine notes. Examples include Ethiopian, Colombian, and Guatemalan coffees. Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Peru, Yemen, and Sulawesi also produce very high altitude coffee beans.


environmental factors:
1. big light swings
2. big temperature swings (lots of sugar production, preservation of acid during cold period)
3. slows down growth ??? making a denser bean

"By growing the coffee at a higher altitude, you are strengthening and making the bean stronger and more resilient. Typically, higher altitudes indicate more acidic/flavorful coffees. The higher altitude stresses the bean by higher variation in day/night, typically steeper hills, less oxygen, higher chance of sunlight, more rainwater with more runoff. Reduces water in the bean, lengthens development, and more sugar development. This also isn't anything more than an indicator or these things sometimes happening, as farmers don't always use the best farming practices, however I usually consider this when blindly cupping coffees.
