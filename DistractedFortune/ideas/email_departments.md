Hello,

Please forgive this email out of the blue.

I am selling coffee mugs I designed, with awesome mathematics emblazoned on the side.

For now, there are three designs:
1. Pythagorean Theorem (with or without the proof)
2. The trigonometric functions
3. The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity

Each mug is $20, shipping included.

Would you or someone you know be interested in drinking from such a highbrow mug?

If so, please either visit my shop below, or reply to this email for more information.

Thank you,
Peter Martinson
