Good Day,

Please forgive this email out of the blue - it is a sales email.  I promise you will receive no further unsolicited emails from me.

Why not refresh your office mug collection with lovingly designed symbols of your vocation?

I am designing coffee/tea mugs emblazoned with mathematics theorems, and selling them for $20 each on my website.  Please consider buying one or more of them.

Thanks for your time.  The mug selection is below.

Kindest Regards,
Peter Martinson

PS If you don't see a theorem or design that you wish existed, please send me the idea!  I am designing new mugs all the time, and need more ideas!

PPS If you have no interest in a mug, please let me know what type of mathematics product would interest you.  I'll see if I can make it a reality.

PPPS Finally, if you know anybody else who might be interested in turning coffee into math with a Math themed mug, please forward this email to them
