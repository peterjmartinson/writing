No!!!  The Product Sucks!!!

What do you do when your first product sample arrives and it sucks?  You either throw the whole idea out as stupid, or you maximize your improvements and try again.

If you've read one of my [earlier posts on the Growth Mindset](https://distractedfortune.com/growth-mindset-versus-influencer-defeat-the-beast-to-succeed/), you know it's important to view failure as evidence used for improvement.

It's easy to take failures and use them as bait for your Inner Critic to come out and punish you.  This manifests in product development as the urge to can the whole enterprise as having been a stupid idea anyway.

The growth mindset says, maybe the evidence suggests an improvement can be made instead.

I sold a few math mugs!  Three were to myself, of course, as samples.  Two were sold to my father in law, and two to an old friend I used to work with.  They are math people - my father in law has [written several articles about math history](https://larouchepub.com/other/2018/4525-sociopathic_lying_th.html), and my friend just [published a collection of correspondences](https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Light-Descartes-Sourcebook-Principle/dp/B0DNFXQM5H) with mathematician [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat).

Sure, both sales are chalked up to sympathy buys, but they helped me complete a few full start-to-finish tests of purchasing.  Both my customers also provided valuable feedback - for example, maybe don't put the whole proof of the Pythagorean Theorem on the mug.

The real feedback, however, came when I got my samples.  They were disappointing.  My Quadratic Reciprocity (QR) mug, which is all text, was too small and blurry.  The chart, which should be imposing and thought provoking, was too hard to read that it appears as something you're not supposed to read.

My first reaction was that this was a stupid idea from the beginning.  Who will buy crappy mugs where you can't even read the math?  I cheaped out on production by choosing a cheap company - [Printful](https://www.printful.com).A  And in general, stop doing this and stop having dreams of big profits.

Then, I remembered [my own advice](https://distractedfortune.com/growth-mindset-versus-influencer-defeat-the-beast-to-succeed/), and decided to instead try to improve the product, and get the best result possible from the producer.  Changing course like this feels like sterring the ship into the wind - it takes almost physical force, even though it's just mental work.

First, I got feedback from my Fermat friend.  He said he actually likes the Pythagorean Theorem mug, but is disappointed in the QR one.  "Not a good advertisement for your business!" he says.  Instead of a refund, though, he wanted a replacement with better quality printing.  In other words, he actually likes and wants the mugs!.

Second, I emailed Printful and asked why the mugs look crappy.  Their response was, some crappieness is expected.  But my imagery also was too small for the mug - I need to maximize the size of my images on the cups.  So, I looked around on their site and found [an actual template](https://printful.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/upload/guideline/Mug_all_sizes.zip).

I used the template to maximize the space used by my QR text, and also added a little branding so my mugs advertise my site.  Now, I'm waiting for new samples.
