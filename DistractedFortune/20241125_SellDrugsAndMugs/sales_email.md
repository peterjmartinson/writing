Hi [Peter],

This is a sales email!

I searched for a coffee mug with cool mathematics on it, and never found much more than E=mc^2 or just random math equations.  These suck, so I designed my own.  Attached to this email are the two first designs:

1. Pythagorean Theorem - Statement of the theorem, and hint for the proof
2. Quadratic Reciprocity - Statement of the law, and a chart with examples

I'm selling mugs with these designs on them for $20 each.  Interested?  Know anyone else that may be interested?

If so, just send me an email (or respond to this one), and we can set up payment and delivery details.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this idea and make the purchase a no-brainer, or other math that you would like to see, let me know.

And yes, I do hope you are doing well!

Yours,
Peter
