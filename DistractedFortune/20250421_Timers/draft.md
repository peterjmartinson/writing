How to use a timer
==================

The symptoms of ADHD are [only recently being understood](LINK the NYT article).  The most accurate, and helpful, way [I've imagined the process is with the chart below](LINK my other article).  For normal people, it doesn't take too much effort to get into a state of focus.  For those of us with ADHD, it takes a lot more work to get to get into that zone.

When something like folding clothes doesn't interest you enough to boost your attention into the zone, you'll get distracted quickly and move on to other things.  And those clothes just don't get folded.

Executive function is not a matter of willpower.  It's a matter of getting the [beast](LINK my article) in you to do what he needs to do.  If you can find a trick to jack up your interest, then you can sustain your focus for longer periods of time, and actually get things done.

It turns out, there's a very easy trick that can do just that.

If you're like me -- put things off until tomorrow, spend an hour researching esoteric topics, can't make decision between two identical choices -- you need a timer.
