How and why to build an email list
==================================

I often get asked (OK, nobody has ever asked) how I grew my email list.  At the moment, I have one subscriber - myself! - so I can't comment on the "grow" part of that question.

However, I have been assembling the capability into my blog recently.

If you are anything like me, you have yet to master time blocking, which means your side projects tend to be done in five to fifteen minute intervals during the day.  It is HARD to get something coherent completed like this.  Especially something that is new and technical.

For example, I find writing works OK in small time chunks.  Between those chunks, I can think about how to structure my articles, come up with better ways to phrase things, and solve various other content issues.

However, adding functionality to the blog's website is very difficult to do in tiny bites, because it's more of a muscle memory operation, which requires remembering the location of menu items or order of operations, as well as time on the internets evaluating various options and vendors.

This article will give you a few tips for how to get an email capture system set up and running with the least amount of hair pulling and teeth gnashing, so you can get back to producing content.  Or whatever it is you do with your site.

## Why build an email list?

You need a reason to set up an email capture system.  Without a reason to prod you in the butt, you will never get it done.

Your email list is your gold for any kind of modern entrepreneurship.  It is your audience.  It represents your ability to grow, sell, and communicate.

Though you could buy a list of emails from some dude in Bulgaria, that list is worth nothing compared to one you grow yourself, through your own site.  When a person gives his or her email to you, they are inviting your material into their lives.  A random cold-call email typically ends up in the spam box, or the trash bin.

An email list is your sales channel.  It's possible to sell via advertisements on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Google.  Yes, some people really do click on the ads in Facebook.  But you will always be at the mercy of their algorithms and rules.

With an email list, you can target your own patrons.  And, if one of the ad platforms goes bonkers for some reason, you don't have to scramble to redo your advertisement system.

Also, with an email list, you can get rapid feedback about content or products.  Your readers will tell you if they liked an article, or if something just sucked.  For example, someone may forward one of your emails to a friend.  Or, they may unsubscribe, which is also valuable feedback.

## Why do you need so many plugins?

I'll go through the steps needed to create a newsletter below.  The first thing I thought is, why is there not just one thing to install?

The real answer is probably, because I'm unwilling to spend money on it until I need to.

When you send an email, the recipient's email provider (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.) runs the email through a few checks to determine if it's a legitimate email or spam.

Wordpress has a native email system that runs from its PHP code.  When an email provider gets an email sent from PHP, it looks like an email sent by a computer program, so it gets marked spam.

Now, since we DO want to send emails in an automated way (like a [welcome mat](LINK) series), we need to make our emails look like they came from a person, which means, at the least, from another email provider.  So we need a plugin that will link Wordpress to one of those providers.

Plugin one - link between Wordpress and Email provider

Then, we need some kind of software that actually sends the email from an email provider.  If you want to use the same plugin, you need to pay.  Since we're going cheap, we need another plugin.

Plugin two - something that actually hits "send" on the email.

Surely one of these plugins can be used to actually capture the emails of people that visit the site, and put them into the list, right?

Nope.  You need another plugin to capture the emails.

Plugin three - something that captures emails into a list.

Luckily, I found that the same free plugin can be used to create the form where your reader types his or her email, as well as the system that aggregates those emails int a list.
