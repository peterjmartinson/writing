How and why to build an email list
==================================

I often get asked (OK, nobody has ever asked) how I grew my email list.  At the moment, I have one subscriber - myself! - so I can't comment on the "grow" part of that question.

However, I have been assembling the capability into my blog recently.

If you are anything like me, you have yet to master time blocking, which means your side projects tend to be done in five to fifteen minute intervals during the day.  It is HARD to get something coherent completed like this.  Especially something that is new and technical.

For example, I find writing works OK in small time chunks.  Between those chunks, I can think about how to structure my articles, come up with better ways to phrase things, and solve various other content issues.

However, adding functionality to the blog's website is very difficult to do in tiny bites, because it's more of a muscle memory operation, which requires remembering the location of menu items or order of operations, as well as time on the internets evaluating various options and vendors.

This article will give you a few tips for how to get an email capture system set up and running with the least amount of hair pulling and teeth gnashing, so you can get back to producing content.  Or whatever it is you do with your site.

## Why build an email list?

You need a reason to set up an email capture system.  Without a reason to prod you in the butt, you will never get it done.

Your email list is your gold for any kind of modern entrepreneurship.  It is your audience.  It represents your ability to grow, sell, and communicate.

Though you could buy a list of emails from some dude in Bulgaria, that list is worth nothing compared to one you grow yourself, through your own site.  When a person gives his or her email to you, they are inviting your material into their lives.  A random cold-call email typically ends up in the spam box, or the trash bin.

An email list is your sales channel.  It's possible to sell via advertisements on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Google.  Yes, some people really do click on the ads in Facebook.  But you will always be at the mercy of their algorithms and rules.

With an email list, you can target your own patrons.  And, if one of the ad platforms goes bonkers for some reason, you don't have to scramble to redo your advertisement system.

Also, with an email list, you can get rapid feedback about content or products.  Your readers will tell you if they liked an article, or if something just sucked.  For example, someone may forward one of your emails to a friend.  Or, they may unsubscribe, which is also valuable feedback.
