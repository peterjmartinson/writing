Omnisend?


WPForms Lite?
  - For building forms to do things, like capture emails
  - BUT they only integrate with Constant Contact, which is a paid serviceo
  - gotta go pro for Brevo

Ninja Forms
  - This is the same as WPForms Lite, but free (I think)


WP Mail SMTP?
  - lets you send from Gmail instead of default mail()
  - I guess, it makes email more reliable?
