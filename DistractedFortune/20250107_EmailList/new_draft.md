How and why to build an email list
==================================

I often get asked (OK, nobody has ever asked) how I grow my email list.  At the moment, I have one subscriber - myself! - so I can't comment on the "grow" part of that question.

I have been building the capability into my blog recently, though.

If you are anything like me, you have yet to master time blocking, which means your side projects tend to be done in five to fifteen minute intervals during the day.  It is HARD to get something coherent completed like this.  Especially something that is new and technical.

For example, I find that I can write in small time chunks.  Between those chunks, I think about how to structure my articles, come up with better ways to phrase things, and solve various other content issues.

Conversely, adding functionality to the blog's website is very difficult to do in tiny bites, because it's more of a muscle memory operation, which requires remembering the location of menu items or order of operations, as well as time on the internets evaluating various options and vendors.

However, I found a bit of a shortcut, which I'll reveal down below.

This article will give you a few tips for how to get an email capture system up and running with the least amount of hair pulling and teeth gnashing, so you can get back to work producing content.  Or whatever it is you do with your site.

## Why build an email list?

First, you need a reason to set up an email capture system.  Without a reason to prod you in the butt, [you will never get it done](LINK my procrastination article).

Your email list is your gold for any kind of modern entrepreneurship.  It is your audience.  It represents your ability to grow, sell, and communicate.

Though you could buy a list of emails from some dude in Bulgaria, that list is worth nothing compared to one you grow yourself, through your own site.  When a person gives his or her email to you, they are inviting YOUR material into their lives.  A random cold-call email typically ends up in the spam box, or the trash bin.

An email list is your sales channel.  It's possible to sell via advertisements on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Google.  Yes, some people really do click on the ads in Facebook.  But you will always be at the mercy of their [algorithms and rules](LINK google changes horror stories).

With an email list, you can target your own patrons.  And, if one of the ad platforms goes bonkers for some reason, you don't have to scramble to redo your advertisement system - you own it!

Also, with an email list, you can get rapid feedback about content or products.  Your readers will tell you if they liked an article, or if something just sucked.  For example, someone may forward one of your emails to a friend.  Or, they may unsubscribe, which is also valuable feedback.

Now that you're convinced you need the emails, let's get into the weeds.

## Why do you need so many plugins?

When you get down to business setting up the email capture system, the instructions are pretty clear.  First do [this](LINK), then [this](LINK), then [this](LINK), then [this](LINK), then [this](LINK), then...  Well, it's not so simple.

Why is there not just one thing to install?  Why do I need to set up so many different components!?

The real answer is, probably, because I'm unwilling to spend money on it until I need to.  But even then, there are a lot of moving parts.

Surely one of these plugins can be used to actually capture the emails of people that visit the site, and put them into the list, right?

Nope.  You need another plugin to capture the emails.

Plugin number three or four - something that captures emails into a list.

And that's a nightmare if you're doing this in chunks.

Luckily, I found a shortcut, at least if you're on [Wordpress](LINK).  Probably other blogging platforms have similar tools.

That shortcut is called [Jetpack](LINK).  You probably know Jetpack as the app that keeps track of how many people visit your site every day.  Or, it's the annoying thing you need to handle while setting up your initial blog, switches for speeding up the site or whatever.

But Jetpack has the ability to both capture subscriber email addresses, and to email newsletters to those subscribers.  The main function of Jetpack's newsletter is to alert your subscribers to new blog posts.  Other plugins can do special email campaigns or other email-only things, but I found a way to arrange things so you can make an actual newsletter.

It's not perfect, but it's free.  Which is pretty close.

## Your First Newsletter

Here's how I set up my newsletter-email-capture system.

1. Find Jetpack in the wp-admin dashboard

The dashboard is where you find all the controls for your blog.  The left panel shows kind of a jumbled mess of links, one of which says "Jetpack".

It's probably very well organized, but that's beyond my powers of 5 minute focus.  Click on Jetpack.

2. Jetpack Settings

First, notice that one of the links in the Jetpack drop down is "Subscribers".  If you click that, you'll be taken to Jetpack's own dashboard, where you can actually see your subscribers.  You can get right back to wp-admin with a link on Jetpack's Dashboard's menu panel on the left.

Another link is "Settings".  Click that.

3. Jetpack Settings > Subscribers  <note CHECK THIS!! >

Jetpack comes with an email capture system baked in!  Look at all the switches that allow you to just turn it on!

Flip them on - you can see which ones in my image below.

4. Configure the form on your post page.

A "form" is the web's fancy term for a place where you can fill in some information on a webpage.  Jetpack's email capture form is just one blank and one button.  That's all I want.  Every extra blank someone needs to fill out adds friction to the process.  I want my subscribers to be able to subscribe with close to zero effort, or else they won't.

One of the switches adds the form to your blog post page template.  This means it will automatically appear at the bottom of every post you write.  There's a link right next to the switch that says <note more something>.  If you click here, you'll be taken to that template, where you can edit the text that appears around the form.

5. Dammit, save everything!

All the changes I made were automatically saved, except for the change to my post template.  Just in case, double check that there's no `save` button you need to click.

6. Write your newsletter as a blog post, with one modification.

My newsletter is composed just like any other blog post.  After writing the thing, you get the option of posting it, or posting _and_ emailing it.
