<note the following is not about SETTING UP EMAIL LIST, but rather SENDING OUT A NEWSLETTER!!>

<TODO write two different articles - email capture, newsletter>

When you send an email, the recipient's email provider (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.) runs the email through a few checks to determine if it's a legitimate email or spam.

Wordpress has a native email system that runs from its PHP code.  When an email provider gets an email sent from PHP, it looks like an email sent by a computer program, so it gets marked spam.

Now, since we DO want to send emails in an automated way (like a [welcome mat](LINK) series), we need to make our emails look like they came from a person, which means, at the least, from another email provider.  So we need a plugin that will link Wordpress to one of those providers.

Plugin one - link between Wordpress and Email provider

Then, we need some kind of software that actually sends the email from an email provider.  If you want to use the same plugin, you need to pay.  Since we're going cheap, we need another plugin.

Plugin two - something that actually hits "send" on the email.
