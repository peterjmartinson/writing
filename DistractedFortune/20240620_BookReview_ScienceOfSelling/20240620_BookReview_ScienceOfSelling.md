Main point of the book is that salespeople have gotten by on intuition instead of proven methods.  Now, with the internet, it's more important to have proven methods.  Hence, science - focus on how people buy.

Somewhere in here, mention the Abundance vs Scarcity mindset (you'll refer to it in future posts), and the actual study.

### Two methods
#### 1. Peripheral Route
"Heuristics" - mental reflexes
These happen BEFORE any actual thinking takes place.  They're not rational, and can cause "people to make predictable errors (Richard Thaler, UofCh).  Evolutionary advantage.

  1. Single-Option Aversion
    Give one option, people won't buy. (10% bought)
    Give two options, people will buy. (66% - 34% for first choice, 32% for second)
    behavioral scientist Daniel Mochon did experiment.
    Brain can't identify value if nothing to compare
  2. Asymmetric Dominance Effect
    If trying to sell an apple and an orange, can't decide, because difference is so dramatic.
    But, Orange, Apple, and Bad Apple, everyone will buy the good apple.
    People will chose the dominant version.
  3. Likability Bias
    Basically, find something you like about a customer, and say it - over and over.
    If you like them, they'll tend to like you, and will buy from you.
  4. Social Proof
    People buy with the crowd.
    Reference past customers, or use reviews
#### 2. Central Route
This is when the buyer commits to the seller's central message.

### Six Whys
this is a registered trademark!

1. Why Change?
  People tend to continue doing things the way they first did it - like sitting in the same pew over and over.
    Answering:
    1. Find Problems and identify them
    2. Understand Problems (don't feature dump)
    3. Make Problems Hurt
2. Why Now?
  Help by mentioning that it's "their choice"
3. Why your industry solution?
  Answering
  1. Show my product gives superior results
  2. Show problems if customer chooses someone else
4. Why you and your company?
  They need to trust you
  1. Demonstrate Expertise
  2. Communicate Confidence (body posture)
5. Why your product or service?
  Show competitive advantage
  1. Cost Leadership (my product is cheaper)
  2. Differentiation (my product is better)
    - Distinct value must matter to the buyer
    - Distinct value must be UNIQUE
6. Why spend the money?
  Use the *dominant buying motives*
  1. Desire for gain
  2. Fear of loss

### Buyer emotions, blah blah

### Powerful Questions
The Onion, not the types of questions
Three levels of question
1. Open topic - reveal thoughts, facts, behaviors, situations
  Get a basic understanding of a subject
  "What's something you're dealing with?"
2. Prompt customer to think through a thought, fact, behavior, or situation.
  Also called _elaboration_question_
  Get customer to state their opinions
  "Why do you think that's happening?"
3. Think through dominant buying motive
  Desire for gain, fear of loss
  "How do you think profit will suffer if this keeps happening?"
  "How do you think company will benefit if this is solved?"
