How to Not Get Things Done
==========================

Story time!

I embarked on my productivity porn addiction back around 2013, when I discovered David Allen's [_Getting Things Done_](LINK).  After skimming a bootleg version of his book on my tiny iPhone, I figured I had found the secret to life!

In short, the goal is to offload all chores, plans, and to-do lists to a filing cabinet, to free your mind from the burden of remembering everything.  Instead of never getting to large projects, you break all projects down into a series of smaller actions.  Each day, you get a bunch of those next-actions in front of you and complete them.

That's it.  [Mind like water.](LINK)

Before you true believers out there pillory me, yes there's more to it.  Like the machine that prints out labels for all the file folders.

Anyhow, I got obsessed, bought two beat up filing cabinets, and filled them with file folders for everything in my life.  And I just couldn't keep up.

I've since tried a few ways to approximate Allen's write-out-all-steps approach, and sometimes have made a bit of progress.  But I could never quite make it take off.

Through the guilt of not feeling strong enough to keep up with all the lists and folders, I kept wondering if maybe this isn't the way.

Then, a few days ago, it hit me.  There _is_ another way!

In this article, I'll describe this other way, which is more like mathematical induction than exhaustive introspection.  And, I think both you and I will become happier and more productive in the end.

## Take Better Steps

I'm reading a book called _Fail Fast, Fail Often_, by A B and C D.  Their strategy so far feels a little like a learned faith.  They studied the happiness and success of over a bajillion people, and have come to the conclusion that the most successful and happy among us act first, and plan rarely.

Most of us are the opposite - we plan always, act never.  The authors instead found that it's through trying new things and failing, that people encounter the most opportunities for growth and success.  Those of us that plan out all our actions before taking the first step tend to blame everyone for our failures, while the fault really lies in our lack of action.

The behavioral therapy these authors suggest are 1. follow your curiosity, and 2. if you feel like doing something, figure out how to fail at it as soon as possible.

But how do I know if my curiosity is leading me in the right direction?  And, if I fail a bunch of times, won't I just go broke and lose my house?

There's a phrase for this kind of thinking:  _trust the process_.

Another great author, [James Clear](LINK), wrote a great book called [_Atomic Habits_](LINK).  His thesis is strangely similar.  To paraphrase:  you will find vastly more success if you concentrate on establishing good habits, than you will by focusing on your future goals.
