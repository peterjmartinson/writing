## The Tripartite Self

Here is a summary of the three beings that comprise your personality:

1. The Beast

The first entity is the one who eats crap, scrolls through endless feeds, and is dazzled by flashy things.  It's also the one who brushes your teeth in the morning, who remembers to wipe well after taking a dump, and checks your blind spot before changing lanes.

This is the creature of instinct and habit.  The chimp that climbed down from the trees so long ago.

The beast will not stop itself.

2. The Rider

The second entity is the one who gets the Beast to wash its hands after using the bathroom, the one who gets it to eat a salad before the lasagna, and the one who remembers to call your mom today.  The Rider is the responsible one, who gets the Beast to do things that are good for you and for others.

When you try to start a new habit, the Rider is the one who works to tame the Beast's worn-in behaviors.

3. The Marshall

The third entity is the dreamer and the planner.  When you say to yourself "I need to stop eating all my boy's Halloween candy", that's the Marshall talking.

The Marshall is the one who comes up with the things you want to do to become a better person, and develops the plan of attack.  It's also the one that gets horrified after you notice you just doom scrolled the afternoon away.  This is the you, watching yourself.  This is your free will.

In people like you and me, it's also the one who tends to get harassed by that pernicious bully, the Inner Critic.

This group of entities work together to make up who you are and what you do.  The Beast is always on the job, just trying to do what it wants to do.  The Rider is sometimes working in harmony with that Beast, gently guiding it to perform miracles; but sometimes the Rider is asleep at the reins, letting old Beast run on autopilot.  The Marshall sometimes jumps in at a moment's notice, and smacks the Rider "Wake Up!  We can't let Beast do this anymore!", but usually the Marshall comes on the scene when things are calmer, like in the early morning, or when you are reading or learning something new.

## How to Build Good Habits

Some of my old friends used to rip on me for being "Kantian".  By that, they meant that my Rider was using the whip too much, to punish the Beast into doing things that were unnatural.

Regardless of whether Kant actually viewed the self like this (I don't know!), whipping poor Beast is both far too easy to do, as well as not effective.  You have to be a bit more generous and forgiving, because the Beast is just doing what it thinks is best.

A fantastic model for how to do this comes from [James Clear's](LINK) book, [Atomic Habits](LINK).  In it, Clear lays out a set of laws for building good habits, and breaking bad ones.

1. Make it obvious

To build a good habit, Clear suggests finding a prompt that will remind you to perform your habit.  That cue could be an alarm, something that happens every day (like, waking up in the morning), or another habit that already exists.

As a cue to your Beast, Clear recommends you design your environment to be conducive to the habit.  He compares the well-disciplined person to the person without discipline.  Usually, it has very little to do with will power, and everything to do with organizing your suroundings to help you accomplish what you want to accomplish.

This is so forgiving for the Beast.  It allows the Marshall to use its gift of creativity to help the Rider maneuver the Beast to desired goals.

In converse, to break a bad habit, you need to remove the cues from your environment.  Get the candy out of your house!

2. Make it attractive

If the Beast wants to go in some direction, and the desired outcome happens to also be in that direction, it will be much easier for the Rider to guide it.

You want to want to do the habit, so pair it with either something you want to do, or something you must do.  If you want to read more books, set up a special super comfy spot in your house just for reading.  If you want to exercise more, ...

3. Make it easy

If you have to do a bunch of stuff just to get to doing your new habit, your Beast will lose patience and give up.  Reduce the number of steps between you and the habit.  For example, if you want to write in your journal in the morning, don't leave your journal in your desk, rather put it right next to your bed.

Likewise, if the habit takes too long to do, your Beast will give up.  Pare your habit down to something that can be done in 2 minutes or less.  Again with the journal - instead of committing to a half hour of journaling, just commit to write one sentence every morning.  If you want to go to the gym, commit to put your gym shoes on every day.  Once you get that tiny habit going, it will be far less work to add more onto it.

4. Make it satisfying

Remember B. F. Skinner?  Skinner demonstrated that, when you reward an animal for doing what you want, the animal will do that more often.  This is called Operant Conditioning.  Skinner once gloated that he could get a pigeon to spin in circles in less than 5 minutes using this method.

Well, we're training our Beast to do the right thing.  After you successfully perform your new habit, give the Beast a treat!  That reinforces the feeling that the habit produces good feelings.  That treat could be a little candy, a bit of TV, a walk around the block, whatever will make you happy.

One particularly effective form of reinforcement was described in the previous post, on [The Chain](LINK).  Clear calls this a Habit Tracker.  Each time you perform your habit, make some kind of visible mark that you did it.  This could be an X on a calendar, adding a paperclip to a chain of paperclips, adding a quarter to your bank, whatever.  Every time you add to that chain, you get a tiny hit of dopamine that reinforces your habit.

## Love the Beast, Help the Rider

The personal trinity may or may not be a real construct, but it certainly helps me to get habits going, and to be more gentle on myself when I screw up.

I am sure that if you start thinking like this about your own life, you will find yourself becoming happier and more effective.

So what are you waiting for, Marshall?  Start training your Beast to better obey its Rider!
