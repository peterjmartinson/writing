  There are ways to make the lift a bit lighter, such as the [two minute rule](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating), but let's focus here on the friction itself.





Every action between you and that target is friction that could be eliminated or shrunk.





I like to think of frictions as anything that slows down or prevents the action.

Let's start with slow down frictions.

In order to get out and exercise, you need to put on your exercise clothes.  Shorts, shirt, shoes, whatever.  This can be a slow down.  For example, let's say you don't have any workout clothes to begin with!  Instead of getting out for a run, you'll spend a half hour on the googles hunting down the perfect workout clothes, and by the time you're done, it's time to get back to work.  No exercise.

Another source of slow-down friction is, what is your workout routine?  Are you going to swing around kettle bells?  Squat some iron?  Run on the treadmill?  You can spend forever figuring this one out.  I have personally gone to the gym, and left before exercising because I couldn't figure out what to do.

Now, how about the stop frictions?  These tend to be more clearly defined.

You have your workout all planned, got your clothes on, but your car doesn't work to get you to the gym.

You caught the flu, and nobody can exercise while sick.

There's a gray area in between these.  The point is to be able to have a broad enough view of what could constitute a friction, so you are able to identify it.









I designed [these mugs](LINK store) a few weeks ago, and they're just not selling as fast as I'd hoped.  I thought, maybe I need to advertise more!  I like brick-and-mortar stuff, so I decided to make some flyers and put them up around town.

Those flyers have not yet been made, printed, or posted.

Why?

The first step in identifying a source of friction is to identify what the ultimate result is you want to accomplish.  In my case, I want people to see my flyers and go to my shop on their phone right away.  Today.

The next step is to identify what are all the actions standing between now and success.

To get my flyers up, I identified the following steps:

1. Fill out my store with more mug designs
2. Design a flyer
3. Build the flyer on the computer, so it can be printed
4. Print a bunch of flyers
5. Get some tape and tacks
6. Get in the car and drive around putting the flyers up

Finally, identify which steps are not absolutely necessary to get to the finish line.  Sometimes, it's useful to think about the ordering - what's the first thing you think of, when you think about getting her done?

In my case, designing more mugs.

That's the friction!  Physically, there is no relation between getting flyers prepped and posted, and how many designs are in my store.  Skip this step!

Another way to identify the friction, is to see which step feels like a lot of work.  Maybe it's too much work?

For me, that's designing the flyer.
