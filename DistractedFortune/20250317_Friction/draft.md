Friction Kills Action
=====================

So you've come up with a plan to start a habit that will make you awesome, like [making cold calls to mining experts to fish for leads](LINK cold calls post).  You picked a time, a date, your phone is charged, you got a name and a phone number, nothing will stop you this time!

The time comes, and you never made the call.

What happened?

Something got in the way, and that something is what we call _friction_.

Friction is anything that delays the completion of an action.  In the case above, maybe it was that you couldn't come up with a good sales pitch.  Maybe you wore yourself out coming up with ways to overcome rejections.  Maybe you needed to find a quiet place to make the call, but spent all day wandering around town.  (I have done all three of these.)

Whatever it was, some activity YOU did prevented the action from happening.

We're going to look today at how to identify sources of friction, and how to remove them, so there is nothing standing between you and success.

## The Source of Friction

When you decide to start practicing some periodic action, from brushing twice a day to writing out your [daily morning pages](LINK morning pages post), there is always a force that will prevent you from doing that action.  This is natural - there is not enough time in the day to do everything we know we should, so we've carefully laid out our days to deal with all the daily challenges of our life.  That's your daily routine.

I think the daily routine is a human adaptation to living in a world.  The daily routine can be done mostly on autopilot.  This allows you to think about other things, instead of constantly considering "what do I need to do next?"

Throwing something new, and possibly awkward, into the mix takes work.

For example, working out every day takes a lot of time out you could be doing other things.  It makes you sweaty, so you need to shower afterwards.  You don't want to exercise on a full stomach, so you need to time your eating before, or maybe get up earlier than usual to do it in the morning.  But, that would mean going to bed earlier, which means rearranging the schedule the evening before.

It would be way easier to just continue with your regular daily routine.

My oldest boy has a daily morning routine, and if something gets missed, he's ready to tear out what little hair I have left on my head.  As soon as he wakes up and comes down to the kitchen, he says "Dad.  Vitamins?"  He gets his vitamins.  Then he gets breakfast - egg bagel and some fruit.

Sometimes, like this morning, we run out of vitamins.  "What, are they too expensive!?  Go out and buy some right now!"  It doesn't matter how often we teach him to be respectful, if we break his routine, it gets tense.

It's because he's thinking about baseball, or homework he needs to complete, whatever.  He wakes up every morning with something on his mind, and he doesn't want to have to think about breakfast.

## Identifying Friction

The punchline is that, to get anything important done, you need to remove as many sources of friction as you can.  Then, the only friction will be the desired action itself.

But that means you need to find the friction.  So, where is it?

Say you want to work out.  As we saw above, that's a heavy lift.  There are ways to make the lift a bit lighter, such as the [two minute rule](LINK GETTING THINGS DONE), but let's focus here on the friction itself.

First, list out the steps it takes to complete the action.

1. Get a gym membership
2. Design a workout routine
3. Schedule an hour for the workout
4. Put on workout clothes
5. Grab a bottle of water
6. Hop in the car
7. Drive to the gym
8. Go into the gym
9. Work out!
10. Drive back home
11. Take a shower

I like to think of frictions as anything that slows down or prevents the action.

Let's start with slow down frictions.

In order to get out and exercise, you need to put on your exercise clothes.  Shorts, shirt, shoes, whatever.  This can be a slow down.  For example, let's say you don't have any workout clothes to begin with!  Instead of getting out for a run, you'll spend a half hour on the googles hunting down the perfect workout clothes, and by the time you're done, it's time to get back to work.  No exercise.

Another source of slow-down friction is, what is your workout routine?  Are you going to swing around kettle bells?  Squat some iron?  Run on the treadmill?  You can spend forever figuring this one out.  I have personally gone to the gym, and left before exercising because I couldn't figure out what to do.

Now, how about the stop frictions?  These tend to be more clearly defined.

You have your workout all planned, got your clothes on, but your car doesn't work to get you to the gym.

You caught the flu, and nobody can exercise while sick.

There's a gray area in between these.  The point is to be able to have a broad enough view of what could constitute a friction, so you are able to identify it.









I designed [these mugs](LINK store) a few weeks ago, and they're just not selling as fast as I'd hoped.  I thought, maybe I need to advertise more!  I like brick-and-mortar stuff, so I decided to make some flyers and put them up around town.

Those flyers have not yet been made, printed, or posted.

Why?

The first step in identifying a source of friction is to identify what the ultimate result is you want to accomplish.  In my case, I want people to see my flyers and go to my shop on their phone right away.  Today.

The next step is to identify what are all the actions standing between now and success.

To get my flyers up, I identified the following steps:

1. Fill out my store with more mug designs
2. Design a flyer
3. Build the flyer on the computer, so it can be printed
4. Print a bunch of flyers
5. Get some tape and tacks
6. Get in the car and drive around putting the flyers up

Finally, identify which steps are not absolutely necessary to get to the finish line.  Sometimes, it's useful to think about the ordering - what's the first thing you think of, when you think about getting her done?

In my case, designing more mugs.

That's the friction!  Physically, there is no relation between getting flyers prepped and posted, and how many designs are in my store.  Skip this step!

Another way to identify the friction, is to see which step feels like a lot of work.  Maybe it's too much work?

For me, that's designing the flyer.
