Friction Kills Action
=====================

So you've come up with a plan to start a habit that will make you awesome, like [making cold calls to mining experts to fish for leads](LINK cold calls post).  You picked a time, a date, your phone is charged, you got a name and a phone number, nothing will stop you this time!  The time comes, and you never made the call.

What happened?  Something got in the way.

That something is what we call _friction_.

Friction is anything that delays the completion of an action.  In the case above, maybe it was that you couldn't come up with a good sales pitch.  Maybe you wore yourself out coming up with ways to overcome rejections.  Maybe you needed to find a quiet place to make the call, but spent all day wandering around town.

Whatever it is, there was some activity YOU did that prevented the action from happening.

We're going to look today at how to identify sources of friction, and how to remove them, so there is nothing standing between you and success.

## The Source of Friction

When you decide to start practicing some periodic action, from brushing twice a day to writing out your daily morning pages, there is always a force that will prevent you from doing that action.  This is natural - there is not enough time in the day to do everything we know we should, so we've carefully laid out our days to deal with all the daily challenges of our life.

Throwing something new, and possibly awkward, into the mix takes work.

For example, working out every day takes a lot of time out you could be doing other things.  It makes you sweaty, so you need to shower afterwards.  You don't want to exercise on a full stomach, so you need to time your eating before, or maybe get up earlier than usual to do it in the morning.  But, that would mean going to bed earlier, which means rearranging the schedule the evening before.

There can be a lot of things that you need to move around to get that new action to even be possible.
