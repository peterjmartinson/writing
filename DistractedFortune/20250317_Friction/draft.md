Slaughter the Friction before Friction kills Action
====================================================

So you've come up with a plan to start doing something that will make you awesome, like [making cold calls to mining experts to fish for leads](LINK cold calls post).  You picked a time, a date, your phone is charged, you got a name and a phone number, nothing will stop you this time!

The time comes, and you never made the call.

What happened?

Something got in the way, and that something is what we call _friction_.

Friction is anything that delays the completion of an action.  In the case above, maybe it was that you couldn't come up with a good sales pitch.  Maybe you wore yourself out coming up with ways to overcome rejections.  Maybe you needed to find a quiet place to make the call, but spent all day wandering around town.  (I have done all three of these.)

Whatever it was, some activity YOU did prevented the action from happening.

We're going to look today at how to identify sources of friction, and how to remove them, so there is nothing standing between you and success.

## The Source of Friction

When you decide to start practicing some periodic action, from brushing your teeth twice a day to writing out your [daily morning pages](LINK morning pages post), there is always a force that will prevent you from doing that action.  That force is your daily routine.

I count two reasons it can be hard to slip a new action into your day.

1. Fear

Fear is the biggest factor that keeps me from taking action.  For example, I get panic attacks before talking to new people.  That's the main reason I ([and others](LINK)) have yet to make cold calls.

But the friction doesn't present as fear.  It presents as added steps between now and the target action.  When I'm planning to make a call, I tend to think I need a fully worked out script, including responses to objections.  I'll spend an hour fighting with that script, and boom, no calls.

2. Routine

Your daily routine comes with inertia.  It's not easy to just throw something else in there.

I think the daily routine is a human adaptation to living in a world.  The daily routine can be done mostly on autopilot.  This allows you to think about other things, instead of constantly considering "what do I need to do next?"

But whatever the origin of the daily routine, your daily activities tend to fill all the available space of that day.  There's rarely an hour in there where you're staring at the wall thinking "wow, I wish I could fill this time with a new activity!"

More likely, if you're a grown up like myself, that hour is really about five minutes, and taken up by a well needed breather.

## Identifying Friction

The punchline is that, to get anything important done, you need to remove or reduce as many sources of friction as you can.  Then, the only friction will be the desired action itself.

But that means you need to find the friction.  So, where is it?

For example, working out every day takes a lot of time out you could be doing other things.  It makes you sweaty, so you need to shower afterwards.  You don't want to exercise on a full stomach, so you need to time your eating before, or maybe get up earlier than usual to do it in the morning.  But, that would mean going to bed earlier, which means rearranging the schedule the evening before.

That's a heavy lift.  Here's a method for identifying what is friction versus necessary actions.

First, list out the steps it takes to complete the action.

1. Get a gym membership
2. Design a workout routine
3. Schedule an hour for the workout
4. Put on workout clothes
5. Grab a bottle of water
6. Hop in the car
7. Drive to the gym
8. Go into the gym
9. Work out!
10. Drive back home
11. Take a shower

Second, identify the _target action_, the purpose of all these steps.  The important step here is number 9 - Work Out!  But look how many steps come before that.

Third, examine the other steps.

Step one is to get a gym membership.  Imagine how long it will take to find a gym, compare membership plans, compare amenities, and so on.  You could spend forever on step one.

Now, do you really need a gym membership to begin exercising?  Maybe you can come up with a different set of exercises you can do at home.

Notice also, this step actually comprises several steps - 1, 6, 7, 8, and 10.  That is a lot of work for one step that is NOT the target action.

The gym membership is friction.  

How about step 2, coming up with the routine?  This could certainly be friction, if a "routine" in your mind is more elaborate than running around the neighborhood and doing some push-ups.  You could spend forever trying to develop a routine, and never actually get to the exercising part.

Step 2 is friction.

How about step 3, scheduling?  Even this could take a while, if your calendar is a mess.  This is seems like friction, but it's not really a step that can be avoided.  Maybe it can be reduced.  Or, maybe scheduling can become its own target action.

Or step 4, workout clothes.  Maybe you don't have any.  You need to either drive to the store and find some, or do some online shopping.  Personally, any activity I pick that starts with "obtain appropriate clothes" is unlikely to happen.  I take forever picking clothes unless I'm in a special state of mind.  But maybe this isn't a big deal for you.  So, maybe friction, maybe not.

Even step 5 could be a point of friction.  Maybe you don't have a bottle.  Maybe you're nuts, and think you need special water from the health food store.  That's going to steal time and momentum to solve!

The point is, any action that needs to happen before your target action can succeed, could be friction.

## Kill All Sacred Cows

If you're serious about your target action, then you need to be serious about eliminating the friction.  You can always add some additional steps back in, but only after that target action itself has been established as part of your routine.

In the above example, you need to get down to maybe one or two steps before the exercise part.  Exercise at home, drink tap water, wear your jeans and dress shoes, whatever you absolutely need to do to have zero space left between you and the workout.

Wait, wear jeans to exercise?

Yes.  If your target action is to exercise, then EVERYTHING that gets in the way can be friction.  For example, how stupid would it be for you to die a few years early just because you were stuck on getting exercise clothes, and could never get to the actual exercising!

You need to look at all intervening steps as sacred cows that should be sent to the slaughter.  You don't have a pair of shorts?  How bad would it really be to take your oldest pair of pants, the ones you don't even wear anymore, hack off the legs, and just run in those?

There's a crazy running competition in Australia, where the competitors run from one side of the continent to the other.  Back in <note YEAR>, the world record was beaten by over a day!  The new record holder wasn't a high performer funded by Red Bull and Nike.  [He was a shepherd](LINK).  He ran the race in his work boots and jeans.

Every action between you and that target is friction that could be eliminated or shrunk.





I like to think of frictions as anything that slows down or prevents the action.

Let's start with slow down frictions.

In order to get out and exercise, you need to put on your exercise clothes.  Shorts, shirt, shoes, whatever.  This can be a slow down.  For example, let's say you don't have any workout clothes to begin with!  Instead of getting out for a run, you'll spend a half hour on the googles hunting down the perfect workout clothes, and by the time you're done, it's time to get back to work.  No exercise.

Another source of slow-down friction is, what is your workout routine?  Are you going to swing around kettle bells?  Squat some iron?  Run on the treadmill?  You can spend forever figuring this one out.  I have personally gone to the gym, and left before exercising because I couldn't figure out what to do.

Now, how about the stop frictions?  These tend to be more clearly defined.

You have your workout all planned, got your clothes on, but your car doesn't work to get you to the gym.

You caught the flu, and nobody can exercise while sick.

There's a gray area in between these.  The point is to be able to have a broad enough view of what could constitute a friction, so you are able to identify it.









I designed [these mugs](LINK store) a few weeks ago, and they're just not selling as fast as I'd hoped.  I thought, maybe I need to advertise more!  I like brick-and-mortar stuff, so I decided to make some flyers and put them up around town.

Those flyers have not yet been made, printed, or posted.

Why?

The first step in identifying a source of friction is to identify what the ultimate result is you want to accomplish.  In my case, I want people to see my flyers and go to my shop on their phone right away.  Today.

The next step is to identify what are all the actions standing between now and success.

To get my flyers up, I identified the following steps:

1. Fill out my store with more mug designs
2. Design a flyer
3. Build the flyer on the computer, so it can be printed
4. Print a bunch of flyers
5. Get some tape and tacks
6. Get in the car and drive around putting the flyers up

Finally, identify which steps are not absolutely necessary to get to the finish line.  Sometimes, it's useful to think about the ordering - what's the first thing you think of, when you think about getting her done?

In my case, designing more mugs.

That's the friction!  Physically, there is no relation between getting flyers prepped and posted, and how many designs are in my store.  Skip this step!

Another way to identify the friction, is to see which step feels like a lot of work.  Maybe it's too much work?

For me, that's designing the flyer.
