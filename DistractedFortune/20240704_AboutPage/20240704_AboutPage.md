Welcome to Distracted Fortune.  Here, you'll get tips and tricks for dealing with our distracting world and your distracted soul, and turn what little attention you can muster into great fortunes.  Fortune here means exactly what you think it means - plain hard cash.  But it also means happiness, luck, and the freedom to make the world what you will.

My name is Peter, I live near Philadelphia with my brilliant wife and two exuberant boys, and I work in finance as a data engineer.  The reason I started this blog is to solve my own problems in public, because I suspect many people deal with the same afflictions as me.  I have the attention span of a gnat, am typically reluctant to speak openly with other people, and can spend hours planning things that I'll never carry out.

I'm the laboratory, and the results of my experiments will be reported to you, dear reader.

My core hypothesis is that all people are capable of creative action.  The missing igredients are two:  1) internal work on building clear and directed attention, and 2) action that elicits response from other people.  so fuck everyone.
