A typical day in the life of a human being dishes up its set of challenges, the which prompt a guy to *think*.  If alone, the person needs to rely on his own memory, skills, and thought patterns.  If in a group, the person can offload some of those responsibilities to others.  For example, say one person is good at finding food while another is good at preparing it.

In the words of a 2015 paper by Mathew Fisher, Mariel Goddu, and Frank Keil, this kind of organization is called a "Transactive memory system".  In these people-systems, each person needs to keep track of two kinds of information - internal memory (what they know) and external memory (where to find other information).  These kinds of systems tend to perform at a higher level than individual-only systems.

In the 2015 paper, [Searching for Explanations: How the Internet Inflates Estimates of Internal Knowledge](LINK), the authors describe several experiments they performed on two distinct groups of people - those who had access to the Internet (i.e. Google search), and those that did not.  By juxtaposing these experiments, they showed that when people use a reputable online search engine, they tend to think they are better at thinking than those without the Internet.  This held even if the two groups were constrained to have exactly the same information to answer test questions.

The review of this study is a perfect introduction to a review of the book [_Low Tech Life_](LINK affiliate), by Jose Briones.  In short, the book is about Jose's transition from a typical life filled with doom scrolling back to a life without constant access to the Internet.

I'll focus on three aspects of this story that I found most relevant to our goals at Distracted Fortune:

1. "Dumb Phones", or at least dumbing down your smartphone, is a great way to shift yourself into the Low Tech Lifestyle,

2. Limiting use of the Internet compels one to build more meaningful relationships with other people,

3. The resultant unfilled minutes and hours allow your ability to think deeply to grow more powerful.

## Dumb Phone Life

Jose begins the book by describing his incredibly degenerate life.  Plowing pizza and soda into the front end; doom scrolling on eff-book on the latest Surface laptop; and buying dumb things on credit.

Not incredibly degenerate.  This is probably pretty close to normal life for most of us right now.  With little direction beyond "pursue your dreams", we don't really know what to do with ourselves.  So we resort to feeding the beast with things that make it feel good in the moment.

After a little while of living this life, Briones describes, he decided to shape up and take control of his world.  Besides developing better health habits, Jose decided to try to break his Internet addition by trying a less fully featured phone.  Briones chose the [Light Phone 2](LINK), which is a smaller phone with an e-ink screen, and few options for apps.

Since you're reading my blog, you are probably familiar with the term "dumb phone".  Back in the days of yore, when we plowed our fields with oxen teams and all Christian masses were still done in Latin, we used mobile phones that could only really make calls and send text messages.  There were some attempts to integrate things like internet and email, but these for the most part were in vain.

Known by a variety of terms - basic phone, feature phone, flip phone, candybar phone, handy - these devices had their heyday around the transition to the 21st Century.  I remember getting my first cell phone, a little blue Nokia, in 2001 when I started graduate school.  Though we tried to use these things while on the toilet, it was just tedious enough to make you bring a book instead.

Dumb Phones are great at calls and texts, but not much else.  No Instagram, no doom scrolling.  Maybe a simple game if you were lucky.

All that changed in 2007, when Apple introduced the iPhone.  This newfangled device allowed us to get the full breadth of the internet in our pocket at all times.  Once the front facing camera was added around 2012-2013, that was the end of the dumb phone.

As Briones so clearly describes, that new constant companion, to whom we now entrust so much of our lives, has also become the nexus of massive distraction.  We use smartphones for important things like directions, remembering phone and other numbers, email.  But if you're honest with yourself (and read a [variety](LINK) of [peer-reviewed](LINK) [studies](LINK)), that little buddy also sucks hours of your day into reading things that have relatively low value, like social media feeds and clickbait articles.  

Over the past few years, a rather small group of intrepid social engineers have begun experimenting with ways to claw back that lost time.  Getting a full dumb phone is one way, because it cuts off all access to social and other internet media if you're not in front of a computer.  However, it may be difficult, both physically and socially, to go so hard core.

Now, there is an entire range of "therapeutic" reductions in smartphone _notif-addiction_.  Simply changing your phone's color settings to grayscale, or deleting social media apps can help neuter your need to check for notifications.  On Android phones, you can install an app that only lets you choose from a few functions, like call and text, to make your phone more boring.  If you really can't handle the temptations of your smart phone, you can do like Briones and get a transition device like the Light Phone, or a similar dumbed-down phone.  These devices still allow you to get on the internet for things like directions and email, but add a helpful bit of friction to do so.

Finally, you can bite the bullet and go full dumb phone.

As Briones explains, doing this is not foolproof - it doesn't cure the underlying addiction.  For this, you will need to do extra work during your freshly unfilled hours.

## Going Places

One of the earliest obstacles Jose encountered was getting to places.  Modern Man, when he wants to go somewhere, offloads his sense of direction to Apple Maps or Google Maps or the Waze app.  Pop in your destination, and let GPS do its work!

Without a smartphone, you need to plan ahead.  And even then, what happens when you get lost, with no phone to tell you where you are?  Reading a paper map is hard enough even when you know where you are on it.

One day, while Briones was headed somewhere, he did indeed get lost.  Then he did something that may strike you with terror - he started asking strangers for directions.  To his surprise, everyone he asked was more or less happy and eager to help.  People like doing things they're good at, and knowing how best to get somewhere local is one of those things.

Going back to the Fisher et al. (2015) study above, we tend to offload certain information to our clan when we can rely on them to remember something.  When we have a smartphone, we offload almost everything onto it about the real world that we otherwise would have to remember, including a sense of direction.  Without the smartphone, we're thrown back into a world where we have to remember a lot more stuff, and flex skills we all but have forgotten.

One way to deal with this is to start talking to people again.  As Briones relates, this leads to building real connection with others, which enriches us far more than relying on the phone.  It enriches the world as well.  When we get back to conversations with strangers, we become agents of rebuilding a true sense of community in our world.

## Low Tech Lifestyle

Well, Jose, when I turn off the TV while my kids are watching it, it only takes a few seconds after the whining stops for them both to say "I'm bored!!"  We're slowly overcoming this as a complaint, but boredom does almost seem like an art lost to the ages.  

First, Briones attempts to craft a lifestyle as far removed from digital electronics as possible.  He does this in a few ways, besides dumbing down his phone.  On the phone itself, Briones limits the app selection to directions, email, and podcasts.  On his personal computer, he first installs a Linux operating system - which traditionally comes with far less bloat than Windows - and then again limits the apps installed to those he absolutely needs.

But he goes further than this.  He puts a charging station at the door of his home, where he and his wife place their phones upon entering.  He got rid of his television, and only watches films once a week using a projector.

Even more extreme, he got rid of his home's WiFi!  Now, they have one room in their home with a dedicated machine connected to the internet via an Ethernet cable.

One thing that Briones doesn't drop is video games.  He curiously limits his gaming time, though, to only during work hours and in his home office.  Personally, I can't imagine a less productive work setup.  However, Briones finds it to be a convenient way to both limit gaming as well as offer a way to revitalize himself during the day.

I had heard of this kind of tactic once before, from my old boss Lyndon LaRouche.  In his autobiography, LaRouche explained that he would go on days-long benders in deep research mode.  During those times, he would handle intellectual exhaustion by listening to and playing classical music.  He found that these intervals of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and the rest would both refresh his mind, and enhance his ability to think.  Video games are not quite the same as classical music, but Briones's strategy may have a similar effect.

Second, Briones embraces the boredom by filling the time with other productive pursuits.  He reads more books.  He takes power walks, which tend to help him come up with ideas and solve problems.  He has taken up physical hobbies.

And he talks to people, including his family.  According to Briones, this is the real prize for reducing tech exposure.

    We cannot claim to be mindful and present without sharing these qualities in our interactions with the people who matter most in our lives.  By prioritizing quality time with our loved ones and engaging in activities that promote genuine connection, we can reap the benefits of a more balanced and fulfilling life.  this shift in focus allows us to rediscover the joys of simple, shared experiences, fostering a deeper sense of understanding and appreciation for the people around us.  In the end, it is through these meaningul connections that we truly enrich our lives and nurture our well-being.

I should note, after the first few minutes of complaints met by silence, my boys usually do find something non-digital to occupy their hands and minds.

## Conclusion

I found out about this book while reading through the /r/dumbphone subreddit.  It's an interesting place to learn about how others are handling a low tech lifestyle.  And it just so happens that Brioones is the moderatoer of the subreddit.
