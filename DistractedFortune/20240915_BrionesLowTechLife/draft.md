A typical day in the life of a human being dishes up its set of challenges, the which prompt a guy to *think*.  If alone, the person needs to rely on his own memory, skills, and thought patterns.  If in a group, the person can offload some of those responsibilities to others.  For example, say one person is good at finding food while another is good at preparing it.

In the words of a 2015 paper by Mathew Fisher, Mariel Goddu, and Frank Keil, this kind of organization is called a "Transactive memory system".  In these people-systems, each person needs to keep track of two kinds of information - internal memory (what they know) and external memory (where to find other information).  These kinds of systems tend to perform at a higher level than individual-only systems.

In the 2015 paper, [Searching for Explanations: How the Internet Inflates Estimates of Internal Knowledge](LINK), the authors describe several experiments they performed on two distinct groups of people - those who had access to the Internet (i.e. Google search), and those that did not.  By juxtaposing these experiments, they showed that when people use a reputable online search engine, they tend to think they are better at thinking than those without the Internet.  This held even if the two groups were constrained to have exactly the same information to answer test questions.

The review of this study is a perfect introduction to a review of the book [_Low Tech Life_](LINK affiliate), by Jose Briones.  In short, the book is about Jose's transition from a typical life filled with doom scrolling back to a life without constant access to the Internet.

I'll focus on three aspects of this story that I found most relevant to our goals at Distracted Fortune:

1. "Dumb Phones", or at least dumbing down your smartphone, is a great way to shift yourself into the Low Tech Lifestyle,

2. Limiting use of the Internet compels one to build more meaningful relationships with other people,

3. The resultant unfilled minutes and hours allow your ability to think deeply to grow more powerful.

## Dumb Phone Life

Jose begins the book by describing his incredibly degenerate life.  Plowing pizza and soda into the front end; doom scrolling on eff-book on the latest Surface laptop; and buying dumb things on credit.

Not incredibly degenerate.  This is probably pretty close to normal life for most Americans right now.  With little direction beyond "pursue your dreams", we don't really know what to do with ourselves.  So we resort to feeding the beast with things that make it feel good in the moment.

After a little while of living this life, Briones describes, he decided to shape up and take control of his world.  Besides developing better health habits, Jose decided to try to break his Internet addition by trying a less fully featured phone.  Briones chose the [Light Phone 2](LINK), which is a smaller phone with an e-ink screen, and few options for apps.

blah blah blah!
