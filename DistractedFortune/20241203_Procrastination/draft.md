How to Trick Procrastination
============================

Do you feel like you're always late for deadlines?  Always "a day late and a dollar short"?

Well, you're not alone.  Procrastination is the #1 most annoying, and debilitating, symptom of ADHD.  Sure, everybody puts things off for another day, but for you and me, procrastination can be just as crippling as losing a leg.

The constant companion of procrastination is that pernicious creep, the [Inner Critic](LINK).  "You're so lazy and stupid."

In this article, I'll explain why procrastination is such a problem for ADHD people, and give some tips on how to thwart this enemy to massive fortune.

## The Due Date is Tomorrow!

Work is a challenge.

If there is a job with a deadline down the road, it's too easy to put it off.

For example, I work as a data engineer for a financial company.  We do sensitive investments, which means that it's pretty important for the analysts to have their data NOW.  My job is to deliver that data.

Sometimes, the vendor (some other company that sends us data) changes the format of their data.  Sometimes this isn't a problem, and sometimes it is.

When they change the format without telling us, and it breaks something, that's just fine.  My adrenaline's running high, and I'm working with the analysts as a team against those irresponsible data suppliers.  When the problem's fixed, I'm a hero.

But if they announce a change they will implement in the future, then there is real danger.

I'm facing down a project like this right now, which is due in just a few days.  I've known about the changes for over a month, and they even pushed the changes off a few weeks.  But our system is not ready for the changes yet.

The issue is that immediate jobs are facing me every day, but that deadline is so far away that I can postpone the work for a little longer.  And then, all of a sudden, it's here.  And so are all the other immediate problems that face me every day.


## Urgency vs. Importance

When experts describe ADHD as a problem with executive functioning, it's both obvious and meaningless to me.  Yes, it's hard to do what I know I should do, and easy to do what's more interesting in the moment.

Knowing it has to do with my executive function offers very little to solve the problem.

One day while following the [ADHD subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd), I came across a description that explained almost everything.

Imagine a scale from 1 to 10.  The scale represents how interesting you find some task.  For most people, there's a division around 3, at which they're willing to get to work.  For ADHD brains, that division is up around 5 or 6.

This is why things like Adderal or Caffeine help us get to work.  Uppers help us drive that interest over the threshold, and then we can get down to business even if we're not really interested in the job.
