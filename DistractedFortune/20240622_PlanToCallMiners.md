Cold Calls Suck: How to Discover True Problems
==============================================

Once upon a time, I worked with an organization that had to raise funds.  The two biggest parts of the job were talking to people at street corners to gather contact information by selling literature, and then calling those people back afterward.  The point was to either get them to donate money, or come to meetings, or both.

But, oh, those calls.  I could sit and stare at that phone for hours and not make a single call.  I would play procrastination games like organizing my contact sheets in the perfect order in which to make the calls.  Or, spend hours scripting out the perfect briefing.  Or, go take a two hour dump while reading a book.

The problem with calls is that it's real time.  When the person at the other end of that line says something, you got to respond in a way that drives toward your goal, and doesn't cause that other person to just hang up.

Well, that's not the only problem.  The bigger problem is, how do you come up with what to say, that doesn't sound like some sales pitch?

In this post, I'm going to describe to you my current get rich scheme - which involves a ton of cold calls - and some practical advice on how to go about carrying out that scheme.  You see, the goal here is twofold: 1. By telling you my plan, I will burden myself with the social pressure to carry it out, and 2. Maybe you will find some of these ideas useful, and use them to go make yourself rich.

## But Solutions Need Problems!

I don't right now have a product, or any idea of a clear market demand.  So, where do I find a pool of customers, and a product that solves a problem for those customers?

Like you, I listen to a bunch of podcasts.  Recently, I've been spending some time with two podcasts on side hustles:  [Side Hustle School](LINK) and [Side Hustle Nation](Link).  One podcast on Side Hustle Nation caught my eye.  It's about this Australian guy who makes cold calls to company bigwigs, and sells them software that he doesn't make.  Basically, he hunts down companies in markets experiencing growth, and calls decision makers in those companies.  When he gets one on the horn, he sweet talks them into divulging a few areas of friction currently facing the company.  When he finds one that could be solved with software, he hires out a few freelancers to build the software, and boom, he's sold a product!

It's probably more difficult than that.  But the main idea is actionable - to find a real problem, talk to people to find their problems.

It reminded me of another podcast I listened to long ago, when I was focused on getting a new job.  This one, called [Free Code Camp](LINK), the guy explained how he got a job that wasn't advertised, and for which he had no experience.  Like the Aussie above, he would hunt down a company he wanted to work for, and a position he wanted there.  Then he would hunt for someone who might end up being his boss or boss's boss, and email them asking for a five minute "informational interview".  When he finally got a call, he would hunt down what the person saw as the biggest challenge facing his team.  After the call, the guy would spend the next week doing research and preparing a solution for that problem.  He'd put the solution together as a PowerPoint presentation, and send it to the boss man.  Boom, who doesn't want to hire someone who already solve the biggest challenge?

One industry I found that is growing in the USA, is mining and resource development.  It turns out, I have a master's in Geology, which means I don't know anything about mining or resource development, but I *think* I do!  So, my get rich scheme involves finding companies taking part in the boom, finding the decision makers, and hustling them to cough up their problems, so I can sell them the solutions.

It couldn't fail!

Now say I get some dude on the horn willing to talk to a random for 60 seconds.  What do I say?  For the record, I'm the exact opposite of a hot salesman who can talk to anyone about anything.  My most comfortable state of being is holed up in my house talking to nobody.

But, progress is not made without taking personal risks.

## The Questions

Well, I started reading a book a few months ago called "The Science of Selling", by David Hoffeld.  The author criticizes modern selling tactics as being born out of instinct instead of teachable skill.  In response, he studied every research paper known to Man about the psychology and behavior related to how people decide to buy.  It's a good book, and worth reading.

One part stood out to me, on how to ask powerful questions.  Hoffeld points out that we're typically taught to ask open ended questions, or questions that can't be answered with a simple Yes or No.  Instead, he describes research that shows we tend to reveal information layer by layer, like an onion.  So, he boiled it down to three successive types of question to ask while hunting for primary buying motivations.

1. Open up the topic to reveal thoughts, facts, behaviors, situations
This is the layer that hunts for areas of friction or pressure.  These are the typical open ended questions we're taught to ask.  Something along the lines of "In your opinion, what are the challenges faced by a growing company like yours?"

2. The Elaboration Questions
Here, you get the person to think through their opinions about what was revealed by the first layer of questioning.  For example, "Why do you think it's so hard to find qualified people for that specific role?"

3. Desire for gain, Fear of loss
Finally, get the person to express their desires or fears related to that problem.  For example, "How much would you say it costs your company in terms of man-hours for each interview that leads to a non-hire?"

I figure, with at least two follow up types of question, I'll be able to get at least some data points

## Taking the First Step

Needless to say, to date, I haven't made any calls.  My goal in the next week or two is to get to just one phone call.  My hangups are my fears of rejection, my lack of time, and my internal critic that says "It's never going to amount to anything."

I'll follow up on this post in a few weeks, and let you know how it's going.  In the meantime, please sign up to get regular updates!
