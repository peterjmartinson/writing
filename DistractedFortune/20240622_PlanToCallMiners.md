Cold Calls Suck: How to Discover True Problems
==============================================

Once upon a time, I worked with an organization that had to raise funds.  The two biggest parts of the job were talking to people at street corners to gather contact information by selling literature, and then calling those people back afterward.  The point was to either get them to donate money, or come to meetings, or both.

But, oh, those calls.  I could sit and stare at that phone for hours and not make a single call.  I would play procrastination games like organizing my contact sheets in the perfect order in which to make the calls.  Or, spend hours scripting out the perfect briefing.  Or, go take a two hour dump while reading a book.

The problem with calls is that it's real time.  Well, that's not the only problem.  When the person at the other end of that line says something, you got to respond in a way that drives toward your goal, and doesn't cause that other person to just hang up.

## But Solutions Need Problems!

My latest get rich quick scheme involves making a ton of cold calls.

In order to come up with a product or service that solves a problem, it's a good idea to know what the problem is, and whether people would pay to alleviate the problem.  The problems I'm familiar with, though - namely my own - already have abundant solutions.  I just don't have the money to buy the solutions!  So, I need to talk to other people to find what real problems exist for them.  Unfortunately, I don't have a very big audience of potential customers.

Hence, my scheme.

It works like this.  Pick an industry with some recent growth.  Hunt down a few companies in that industry, and a few decision makers in those companies.  Email those people to request a five minute "informational interview", to get their opinions on where are the biggest areas of growth and challenge in the industry.  Then, call them and sniff out where their current problems are.  Finally, come up with solutions for those problems in return for cash payment.

Simple!

Now say I get some dude on the horn willing to talk to a random for 60 seconds.  What do I say?  For the record, I'm the exact opposite of a hot salesman who can talk to anyone about anything.  My most comfortable state of being is holed up in my house talking to nobody.

But, progress is not made without taking personal risks.

## The Questions

Well, I started reading a book a few months ago called "The Science of Selling", by David Hoffeld.  The author criticizes modern selling tactics as being born out of instinct instead of teachable skill.  In response, he studied every research paper known to Man about the psychology and behavior related to how people decide to buy.  It's a good book, and worth reading.

One part stood out to me, on how to ask powerful questions.  Hoffeld points out that we're typically taught to ask open ended questions, or questions that can't be answered with a simple Yes or No.  Instead, he describes research that shows we tend to reveal information layer by layer, like an onion.  So, he boiled it down to three successive types of question to ask while hunting for primary buying motivations.

1. Open up the topic to reveal thoughts, facts, behaviors, situations
This is the layer that hunts for areas of friction or pressure.  These are the typical open ended questions we're taught to ask.  Something along the lines of "In your opinion, what are the challenges faced by a growing company like yours?"

2. The Elaboration Questions
Here, you get the person to think through their opinions about what was revealed by the first layer of questioning.  For example, "Why do you think it's so hard to find qualified people for that specific role?"

3. Desire for gain, Fear of loss
Finally, get the person to express their desires or fears related to that problem.  For example, "How much would you say it costs your company in terms of man-hours for each interview that leads to a non-hire?"

I figure, with at least two follow up types of question, I'll be able to get at least some data points

## Taking the First Step

Needless to say, to date, I haven't made any calls.  My goal in the next week or two is to get to just one phone call.  My hangups are my fears of rejection, my lack of time, and my internal critic that says "It's never going to amount to anything."

I'll follow up on this post in a few weeks, and let you know how it's going.  In the meantime, please sign up to get regular updates!
