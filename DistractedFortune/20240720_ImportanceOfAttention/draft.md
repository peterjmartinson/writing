Pay Attention!  Mankind's destiny depends on this
=================================================


Recently, my kid's school held a little book club meeting for the parents.  The topic was [Jonathan Haidt's](LINK) new book, [The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness](LINK).  The meeting was what you'd expect from a classical, closet conservative primary school - lots of PhDs singing choir to the melody scored within the book.  The main thesis is that kids who hit adolescence after about 2012 have had what's needed for developing strong character removed from their lives, and replaced by intense addiction to the social draws of the online world, primarily represented by smartphones and online gaming.

A ton of the book resonated strongly with me.  For example, I do remember riding my bike around town with my friends around 10 years old, and getting into truly risky situations.  Parents in my social circles would *never* let their kids get into risky situations, outside parental supervision.  I still hark back to lessons learned during those times, while navigating the adult professional world.  Where do kids learn those kinds of lessons today?

But the big topic that grabbed me, and is absolutely pertinent to my blog here, is the subject of attention fragmentation.  It's been kind of an undercurrent subject over the past decade or two that attention spans are shortening dramatically, and that it's due to the prevalence of smartphones.  However, the synopsis of how our attention has been _intentionally_ broken up over the past decades is downright spooky.

So, what's so important about attention?

## What is, and why develop, your attention?

Human beings have landed on the Moon.  We proved the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, _from the Earth_.  We split the atom, and put it back together.  We feed _far_ more people than the habitable land could support naturally.  And we tend to live two to three times longer than the average person lived 200 years ago, because we discovered and learned to fight invisible entities called germs.

How are these things possible?  One word - OK, a few more than one word:  Man was created with the ability to discover principles that govern actions in the universe, then develop technologies that leverage those principles to increase our power to survive in this universe.  To make those discoveries, you need to sustain attention.

According to <argh some dude>, attention is "(h)aving the choice of several trains of thought to pursue, and choosing one."  Losing attention is when that train jumps the track.  It takes effort to keep that train on the right track, sometimes almost physical effort.  But you find that, if something is worth your attention, your mind has the ability to get *very* deep into the subject if you give it the attention it deserves.

For example, you're probably one of 90% of schooled adults who had to analyze a poem in primary or secondary school.  You are also probably one of the 90% of people whose eyes just glazed over at the mention of poetry!  It takes a LOT of attention to sit still and think long enough about a poem to dig the meat out of it.  Take this one - a famous sonnet from Shakespeare, pretty short at 14 lines:

[sonnet]

You probably didn't even pay attention long enough to read the last line!

But that's OK, because the point here is that training your attention on some task that doesn't have an immediate feel-good effect, for an extended time, is hard work.  But, if you are one of the readers who have actually analyzed a poem or two in the past, you know that the reward is worth it.  The effect can be seen when you finally get it, and a smile pops on your face.

Go give that poem above another try now.  Give it about 15 minutes, the next sentence can wait.

## How your attention is being usurped

Your attention span is extremely valuable.  So valuable, that it is the primary commodity of the five largest companies in the world.

The way platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube make money, is by feeding your attention to advertisers.  When you're scrolling your feed, see an ad for something like the new Acme toilet plungers, and then can't last one more minute without flipping open Amazon to buy an Acme plunger before your toilet explodes, Google just got paid for your purchase.  These platforms expend billions of dollars a year to refine their algorithms for tailoring ads for exactly your desires, because then other companies will pay them to place those ads for your attention.

If the Googles and Metas couldn't steal your attention, then nobody would pay them for ad space.  Your attention is their product.

So let's look at what companies do to keep your attention on their platforms.  Haidt cites a book by Nir Eyal called [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](LINK) for the general pattern.  Eyal says the model for making something addictive has four components:

1. Trigger - this is the something that first catches your attention.  The vibration of your phone, the *ding* of a notification, the picture of cheesecake on the restaurant table
2. Action - The trigger causes you to want you to do something.  Check your phone, eat the second doughnut, put one more coin in the slot machine.
3. Variable Reward - This is the kicker, which I'll talk about more below.  Not every action causes the shot of pleasure, but enough that you know there's one in there somewhere.
4. Investment - This is the secret sauce of social media platforms.  You put a little of yourself into the program, so you need to see how your investment is doing.

Components 1 through 3 are how lottery tickets work.  I got into scratch off tickets when I was in my early teens, because my mom wanted me to see how it works, and there was a gas station kiddie corner to the house.  You pay a buck and get a ticket, which you then scratch off to reveal the prize.  You win a couple bucks every once in a while.  Each time you scratch off and lose, you think "maybe the next one," and you buy another.

This is called the _variable-ratio schedule_, which behavioral psychologists found drives the strongest and post persistent behavior.

<quote>
  When you put a rat into a cage where it has learned to get food by pressing a bar, it gets a surge of dopamine in anticipation of the reward.  It runs to the bar and starts pressing.  But if the first few pressses yield no reward, that does not dampen the rat's enthusiasm.  Rather, as the rat continues to press, dopamine levels will go _up_ in anticipation of the reward, which must be coming at any moment!.  When the reward finally comes, it feels great, but the heightened levels of dopamine make the rat continue to press, in anticipation of the next reward, which will come...after some unknown number of presses, so just keep pressing!

Social media platforms have mastered this principle with two specific innovations.

1. Pull to refresh - Your feed loads at the top.  Pulling down with your thumb is the natural motion to see what's new.  When you do, the little "checking" circle spins at the top.  Sometimes it refreshes with a new post, sometimes it doesn't.  Never mind the fact that the new post will appear at the top regardless of whether you pull to refresh!  Each time you pull, you get a little jolt of anticipation, a little dose of dopamine.

2. Bottomless scroll - Sometimes your internet connection sucks, and you can see this in action.  When you get to the bottom, it takes a while for the feed to show more.  But generally, more posts get added to the bottom of the webpage without you noticing, so you can just keep scrolling forever.  "Doomscrolling".  You can scroll for a while before there's anything really interesting.  But there might be something just below, so you keep scrolling, in anticipation of something incredible.

## The phantom vibration

When you were working on that poem up above, how many times did your phone notify you with some new update?  If you're like the average American, at least two or three times.

With each ding or vibration, your attention flits to the feed.

"Maybe someone liked my post!"

"I bet that's that one email!"

"Did Biden just drop out of the race?!"

Each time your attention flits, it takes effort to bring that attention back to what you were doing.  Even if you phone isn't dinging and buzzing, it builds a habituated pattern of thought, where every couple minutes, you think about checking your phone for a notification.  Once upon a time, I would even start feeling the periodic vibrations on my hip when I didn't have my phone with me.

So you end up only spending about half the allotted time paying attention to your work, and that attention is fragmented into little spurts.  There's no way to get deep into the material at all.  Some people like to lie to themselves by saying they're multitasking, but [there is no such thing as multitasking](LINK), only context switching.

## The glimmer of hope

People used to read poetry, and watch long stage productions.  People used to read the Bible - the _whole thing_.  Each of the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas lasted several hours, not the barely one hour presidential debates of today.  People used to have the power to direct their attention, and keep it there.

After doom scrolling for an hour, we don't feel exuberant with joy, but rather deflated.  Your mind thirsts for the kind of deep concentration needed to really find things out.  That's the feeling of maybe having gotten some things done, but those things didn't move the needle of your life.

It takes concentration to build a business, for example, because there are a lot of boring, tedious, and attention-challenging tasks that need to be done.  It takes long, hard work to ...


## Tips to improve your attention

Here are some things I've found to help train my attention to stick on a topic for more than one minute:

1. Pomodoro technique

The [Pomodoro Technique](LINK) is a practice where you set two timers, one for 25 minutes, and one for 5 minutes.  First, start the 25 minute timer, and use that time to focus on one task.  When it goes off, start the 5 minute timer, stand up, walk away from your work, and take a break.  After that one goes off, go back, sit down, and start the 25 minute timer again.  Each cycle of 25 minute work, 5 minute break, is called one Pomodoro.

The reason this works is because, when your mind starts drifting, you can remind yourself that a break is not far away, and bring your attention back to the task at hand.  I find it helps to keep a pen and piece of paper nearby to write down anything that grabs my attention, so I can attend to it during the 5 minute break.

1. Morning pages

For this, you need three pieces of paper, and something to write with.  As soon as you get up in the morning, start writing down whatever is in your head.  Don't stop until you've filled those three pages.  And, it doesn't matter what you write, even if it's "I hate this, I hate this, I hate this".
