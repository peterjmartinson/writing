Pay Attention!  Mankind's destiny depends on this
=================================================


Recently, my kid's school held a little book club meeting for the parents.  The topic was [Jonathan Haidt's](LINK) new book, [The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness](LINK).  The meeting was what you'd expect from a classical, closet conservative primary school - lots of PhDs singing choir to the melody scored within the book.  The main thesis is that kids who hit adolescence after about 2012 have had what's needed for developing strong character removed from their lives, and replaced by intense addiction to the social draws of the online world, primarily represented by smartphones and online gaming.

A ton of the book resonated strongly with me.  For example, I do remember riding my bike around town with my friends around 10 years old, and getting into truly risky situations.  Parents in my social circles would *never* let their kids get into risky situations, outside parental supervision.  I still hark back to lessons learned during those times, while navigating the adult professional world.  Where do kids learn those kinds of lessons today?

But the big topic that grabbed me, and is absolutely pertinent to my blog here, is the subject of attention fragmentation.  It's been kind of an undercurrent subject over the past decade or two that attention spans are shortening dramatically, and that it's due to the prevalence of smartphones.  However, the synopsis of how our attention has been _intentionally_ broken up over the past decades is downright spooky.

So, what's so important about attention?

## What is, and why develop, your attention?

Human beings have landed on the Moon.  We proved the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, _from the Earth_.  We split the atom, and put it back together.  We feed _far_ more people than the habitable land could support naturally.  And we tend to live two to three times longer than the average person lived 200 years ago, because we discovered and learned to fight invisible entities called germs.

How are these things possible?  One word - OK, a few more than one word:  Man was created with the ability to discover principles that govern actions in the universe, then develop technologies that leverage those principles to increase our power to survive in this universe.  To make those discoveries, you need to sustain attention.

## How your attention is being usurped

Your attention span is extremely valuable.  So valuable, that it is the primary commodity of the five largest companies in the world.

First, let's look at what companies do to keep your attention on their platforms.  Haidt cites a book by Nir Eyal called [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](LINK) for the general pattern.  Eyal says the model for making something addictive has four components:

1. Trigger - this is the something that first catches your attention.  The vibration of your phone, the *ding* of a notification, the picture of cheesecake on the restaurant table
2. Action - The trigger causes you to want you to do something.  Check your phone, eat the second doughnut, put one more coin in the slot machine.
3. Variable Reward - This is the kicker, which I'll talk about more below.  Not every action causes the shot of pleasure, but enough that you know there's one in there somewhere.
4. Investment - This is the secret sauce of social media platforms.  You put a little of yourself into the program, so you need to see how your investment is doing.

Components 1 through 3 are how lottery tickets work.  I got into this when I was in my early teens, because my mom wanted me to see how it works.  And there was a gas station kiddey corner to the house.  You pay a buck and get a ticket, which you then scratch off to reveal the prize.  You do win a couple bucks every once in a while.  Each time you scratch off and lose, you think "maybe the next one," and you buy another.

This is called the _variable-ratio schedule_, which behavioral psychologists found drives the strongest and post persistent behavior.

  When you put a rat into a cage where it has learned to get food by pressing a bar, it gets a surge of dopamine in anticipation of the reward.  It runs to the bar and starts pressing.  But if the first few pressses yield no reward, that does not dampen the rat's enthusiasm.  Rather, as the rat continues to press, dopamine levels will go _up_ in anticipation of the reward, which must be coming at any moment!.  When the reward finally comes, it feels great, but the heightened levels of dopamine make the rat continue to press, in anticipation of the next reward, which will come...after some unknown number of presses, so just keep pressing!

The social media platforms have mastered this principle with two specific innovations.

1. Pull to refresh - Your feed loads at the top.  Pulling down with your thumb is the natural motion to see what's new.  When you do, the little "checking" circle spins at the top.  Sometimes it refreshes with a new post, sometimes it doesn't.  Nevermind the fact that the new post will appear at the top regardless of whether you pull to refresh!

2. Bottomless scroll - Sometimes your internet connection sucks, and you can see this in action.  When you get to the bottom, it takes a while for the feed to show more.  But generally, more posts get added to the bottom of the webpage without you noticing, so you can just keep scrolling forever.  "Doomscrolling".
