Once upon a time, I was with my wife and two boys at another kid's birthday party.  The party was at an outdoor tree house playground, with zip lines and obstacle courses.  A boy's dreamland.

My job was to keep an eye on my younger boy, who tends to be more fearless than the older one.  My anxiety was high, because I had just lost him a few days before.  So, I followed him around, making sure I always had a sight line to his position.

But the birthday boy's dad is an old friend, and we started talking about real estate.  You see, I work for a hedge fund that specializes in distressed properties, so that's usually where I start when someone asks me "How's work?"  My friend apparently had done his homework, and briefed me on how a lot of rental homes were getting bought up by hedge funds, like Blackrock, and then rented out at rather high rates that tend to screw the little guy.

And I lost view of my boy.  Trying to be calm, I kept the conversation going while I scanned the area for the little rascal.  After a while of this futile act, I broke conversation, and hunted throughout the park for him.  I couldn't find him anywhere, and finally my wife called my cell phone.

"Peter, are you watching number two?"

"Yep, I'm just running to keep up."

"Where is he?"

I was caught.  I had no idea.  "I, um, don't know.  I'm looking for him now."

"He's standing right here Peter.  You had one job.  What the hell?"

## My Meds

I had first started taking atomoxetine (Strattera) around age 45, when I got my ADHD-Inattentive diagnosis.  Soon after, I tacked on buproprion (Wellbutrin).  Strattera is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and nobody knows why hit helps people with ADHD.  It made me feel like my feet were on the ground.  Wellbutrin is an antidepressant, which made me feel more like taking action than sitting back and planning forever.

For the first time in a looong time, I felt like I could start functioning at the top of my abilities, and actually stay there.

One month, I didn't get my Strattera prescription refilled on time, and I was stuck just taking the Wellbutrin.  I figured I'd see how it goes, maybe I had figured out enough coping skills while on Strattera to handle the vacation.  And, maybe the Wellbutrin was the real workhorse anyhow.

That's when I started losing my boy, and generally feeling like I was always about to forget something unless I tried REALLY HARD to remember.  Since then, I've taking my Strattera every day.

## Take Your Meds

I'm not an expert on ADHD, so talk to your psychiatrist before taking my advice.  However, medication has really changed my life.  And, I did the experiment to prove it.

There are some who think that taking drugs that mess with your mind is a bad idea.  I used to associate with an organization that taught ADHD was a made up illness, made up to provide an excuse to administer creativity-killing drugs to abnormally bright kids.

Now that I'm actually taking said drugs, I don't think that.  I have no problem coming up with ideas that are just as creative as I did years ago, and I also have the concentration span to follow my dreams, and take care of my family.

So, if you have ADHD, are having a hard time, and haven't attempted medication prescribed by a professional, then please give it a try.  It may change your life.
