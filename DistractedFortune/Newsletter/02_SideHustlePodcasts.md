Here are three links worth your time.

1. [Side Hustle School](https://sidehustleschool.com/)

Chris Guillebeau puts out a different 8 minute episode every day, with themes for each day of the week (Throwback Thursday, Failure Friday, etc.).  Breadth, not depth.

2. [Side Hustle Nation](https://www.sidehustlenation.com/side-hustle-show/)

Nick Loper also profiles successful side hustlers, but his shows are usually around an hour long.  Think depth, not breadth.

3. [Noah Kagan Presents](https://noahkagan.com/podcast/)

Noah Kagan wrote "[Million Dollar Weekend](https://distractedfortune.com/million-dollar-weekend-the-world-inside-and-the-world-outside/)", and interviews millionaires to learn how they think.  Breadth and depth!

I have confidence in you.  Now get back to work.
