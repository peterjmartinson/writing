Hello,

Since this is the inaugural Distracted Fortune newsletter, I'll explain the goal:

Distractions are devouring your time, time you want to use for important work.

In fact, you're probably reading this email while you were in the middle of something big.

Each week, I'll send you an email with three links I believe are worth your time.  The purpose is to inspire you to get back the business of building your future glorious self.

Here are three links worth your time.

All three are mailing lists that I'm currently on, and always find useful or inspiring.

1. Quincy Larson from Free Code Camp
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-am-i-not-getting-quincy-larsons-email-anymore
These emails from Quincy actually the format of my newsletters.  Each week he sends out five links worth your time.  Quincy's mission is to help everybody learn how to program computers, and his optimism is infectious.

2. Codie Sanchez from Contrarian Thinking
https://contrarianthinking.co/subscribe/
Codie is famous for buying boring businesses, like laundromats or HVAC contracting companies, and getting rich off them.  Her emails are shorter than the time it takes to decide whether to read them, and will leave you inspired.

3. Beth Moncel and team from Budget Bytes
https://budgetbytes.com/contact
This is just a simple recipes newsletter.  The hook is that Beth Moncel's recipes always use inexpensive ingredients that you probably have around the house, so you can cook at home on a tight budget.  The recipes are typically tasty.

If you like these emails, support my work with a purchase:  https://distractedfortune.com/store

I have confidence in you.  Now get back to work.
