When reading an About page, it's incumbent on the creator to give you, Dear Reader, sufficient reason to stick around.  A compelling origin story, as it were.

Two of my goals before I die are as follows.  First, I want to have sufficient assets to both retire without my two boys having to support me, and to bequeath them an abundant inheritance.  Second, I want at least a portion of my community (local and international) to celebrate my life and the good I've done for the world.

Nothing too special.

My current state of life is not commensurate with either of those goals.  I work an IT job that, while providing a healthy income, leaves us with little left over for the future.  More importantly, I have an awful time planning for that future, and an even worse time sustaining preparation for it.

I get distracted easily, and am generally fearful of taking risks.  And specifically, I get worried about what other think of me, which is real distracting!

Hence the blog.

I'm using this space to write about tips, habits, and hacks I've found to help achieve my goals, as well as document my progress toward those goals.

And that kills a few birds with one stone:
1. I get to submit myself to the whims of public opinion - exposure therapy,
2. My ideas and progress get documented for my future self, 
3. And maybe I'll help others who are in a similar situation.

And who knows, maybe I'll be able to turn this venture into a million bucks!

I hope you enjoy reading, and get something useful out of these pages.
