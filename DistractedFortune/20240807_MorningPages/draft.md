Write Right When You Wake Up!
=============================

A couple years ago, when I told my wife about a podcast I'd listened to by psychologist Jordan Peterson, she suggested I listen to his talks on the Bible.  I knew Peterson as the guy who took a lot of heat in Canada for speaking out against the pronoun regulations imposed on some of the universities up there.  It turns out, this guy did a bunch of work on the Bible and other ancient stories, and how they can inform our behavior and psychology of today.

So I started with the earliest Bible talk in his podcast series, [on Genesis](LINK).  To put it gently, it blew me away.

I won't try to summarize it here, you should listen to it.  The concept that stuck out to me was that we go through life in a dreamlike state, where reality mixes with our imagination in a ways that creates a special world for each of us.  We interact with the real world through this half-dream state.  This allows us to solve certain problems in real life through our actual dreams.

Everybody dreams, though not everybody remembers every dream.  Some people remember none of their dreams, some people not only remember their dreams but can act with agency inside their dream ("lucid dreaming").  Most of us remembers a few dreams now and then.  And sometimes, those dreams give us ideas that are actually useful in real life.

Putting this all together, I decided to resume a practice I'd started back before my first boy was born - Morning Pages.  I did morning pages for a few months, then fell off.  After listening to Peterson on the Bible, I started anew, with the goal of at least writing down any dream fragments I could remember, each morning, as soon as I woke up.

It's now an engrained habit I do daily, and I feel off if I miss a morning.  It's so important to me, that I recommend you do it too.

## What are morning pages?

[Morning Pages](LINK) are probably not a completely new idea, but they were popularized by [some lady](LINK).
