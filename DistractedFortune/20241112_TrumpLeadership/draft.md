E Pluribus Unum: The Real Reason Trump Won
==========================================

This may not be something you want to read on a personal self-help blog, but I think it's a useful lesson for those of us who want to become significant figures.

The national diversion in the days since the latest presidential election, is to watch various pundits, politicos, and partisans explain why the Harriz/Walz campaign lost so completely against Donald Trump.  Maybe it's because the nation has just gone majority racist, mysoginistic, and transphobic.  Maybe it's because Kamala didn't reach out hard enough to the working class.  Maybe it's because Biden didn't step aside early enough.  Maybe it's because there wasn't a Democratic primary.  Maybe people were just terribly misinformed by the internets.

There is probably an element of truth in most of these reasonings.  However, I believe the entire line of argument is flawed from a philosophical standpoint.

Trump won because he represents a true leader, and displayed this quality repeatedly, publicly during the past four year.  Harris lost because she is no leader, by definition.  Harris is a vessel inhabited by the Democratic party leadership.

This was a Platonic election.  See if you can follow my reasoning.

## The One and the Many

Most of Plato's dialogues consist of his teacher, Socrates, talking with young Athenians about various principles like virtue, justice, love, friendship, and so on.  The dialogues typically proceed with Socrates asking questions of these young people, and thereby getting to deeper and deeper ideas.

One such line of questioning appears over and over across the dialogues.  For example, in the Meno dialogue, the following exchange occurs:

[[ discussion about birds ]]

When asked to define a concept, the young interloper typically answers by giving examples of that concept.  But, says Socrates, I asked you to define the concept, not give me examples of manifestations of that concept!

Every true principle, such as justice or leadership, can be manifested in an infinite variety of ways.  Another way to think about this is that each principle results in a variety of effects.

Take the principle of gravity.  This principle can manifest in a rock falling off a cliff.  It can also manifest as the orbits of moons and satellites.  It can also manifest as a bending of light, such as in the phenomena of [gravitational lensing](LINK).  But none of these manifestations IS gravity, they're just the effects.

This relationship has come to be called the principle of the One and the Many.

In a not insignificant coincidence of history, America's founding fathers drew on this concept when declaring the slogan of the United States - e pluribus unum (the many are one)

Leadership is such a principle.  When a leader exerts true leadership, there are real effects.  People get inspired.  The leader fights against apparently insurmountable odds.  He does things that aren't popular and great gnashing of teeth ensues.

But these are all just effects.  The principle is something that has to be inferred by the imagination, because it can't be touched directly with any of the senses.
