Million Dollar Weekend: The world inside, and the world outside
===============================================================

The three main ideas I'll pull from this book here are as follows: 1) You must start NOW, or at least really soon, 2) Spend no money on your startup, take in prepayments instead, 3) Experiment, experiment, experiment.

Let's start with the first one first, because it's the easiest to describe without getting too philosophical.  But don't worry, we will get philosophical below!

## 1. Start NOW

Though this is Kagan's first step, it is probably the hardest part of the book to follow.  It's just so damn scary to ask someone to give you money for something!

Kagan tells the story of his dad, the copy machine salesman.  After spending a day following his dad around on countless sales calls, with only two successes, they grabbed a bite to eat.

       "Why you look so sad, Noah?" he said as we sat down to eat.

       I shook my head, "So many noes.  No, no, no, no.  All day.  Doesn't it make you want to quit?" I asked.

       My dad replied with something that would change my life:

       "Love rejections!  Collect them like treasure!  Set rejection goals.  I shoot for a hundred rejections each week, because if you work that hard to get so many noes, my little Noah'le, in them you will find a few yeses, too."  Maybe that's why he named me NO-ah, to remind me of this daily to keep going.

Kagan's dad may not really have loved getting the "No" so often.  He used these rejections, though, as a kind of scorecard.  It's a numbers game.  The more times you ask, the more likely you will get to YES.

Each No you hear is more evidence to show yourself that you are working to find that Yes.

An added benefit of getting those Nos, is that you can always use the feedback to improve your next pitch.

In fact, since you haven't even made the product yet, getting that feedback allows you to modify your product.  Kagan suggests that, each time you get a No, ask that prospective customer how you could change the product "to make it a no-brainer."  Maybe, with a small modification, that No could even be transformed into a Yes.

This brings us to number 2.

## 2. Spend No Money

This is a novel strategy from Kagan.  The essence is that, before you decide that online lifestyle coaching will be your next side hustle, and you spend $20,000 for a course, you need to validate your plan first.

In computer programming, sometimes we call this "fail fast".  You don't want to spend your resources building something that the customer doesn't even want, because it will be a lot of effort wasted by you.  If your plan is shown to fail fast - like, in the span of one weekend - then you know that it's not a winner!  It won't bring in a million dollars!

According to Kagan,

        The Golden Rule of Validation

        Find three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you money for your idea.
        Success means moving quickly and spending no money.  And that's what makes the Golden Rule of Validation so effective.  Here's why it works so well:

        - *You'reallowed only forty-eight hours.*  Limitiations breed creativity.  Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting wantrepreneur inside you and force you to iterate fast and be creative until you find something that works.

        - *Get your first three customers.*

        - *Collect money up front.* The _promise_ of payment is not valdation.  That's polite rejection.  Getting customers to hand over their dollars makes it real.

        The point is, if you can get someone to give you money quickly just by describing a product or solution, you're good!

When you come up with an idea, sketch out how much it should cost per person.  Then, reach out to 3 people, and ask them to give you money NOW for the product.  You will deliver the product by a set future date.

Now, you have a bit of operating capital with which to fund the initial product offering, and you also know that people are willing to pay for it _even if they have never seen it!_

If you're nervous that you might not be able to deliver, you can always add a caveat in the sales pitch, that you'll give the money back if something goes wrong.

This seems to be a special advantage we have in the 21st Century.  Most people in the Western world are now comfortable giving some online outlet, like Amazon, a bunch of money up front, and then waiting up to a few weeks to receive the product.  The "spend no money" strategy leverages this new cultural habit to your advantage.  And, with services like Venmo and PayPal, you can do the whole thing without leaving your house.

You might actually get money rolling in!  And you might get a bunch of NOs!  That's good too, because of the second important strategy: Experiment often.

## 3. Experiment, Experiment, Experiment

Kagan notes that one trait entrepreneurs tend to have, is the willingness to fail over and over in pursuit of a venture that sells.  In that sense, the concept here is not new.  But Kagan's emphasis on this practice brings it to light for those of us who grew up in a cave.

Kagan says it best here:

        Overthinking seems like the "smart" way to launch, but it's far less effective.  Super-successful people do the opposite - they take action first, get real feedback, and larn from that, which is a million times more valuable than any book or course.  And quicker!

        Any analysis ahead of action is purely speculation.  You really do not understand something until you've done it.  Rather than trying to plan your way into the confidence to act, just start acting.

To find a business idea that will bring in cash, you need to _try things_ to see what will sell.  You can't come up with an idea, just believe it will work, and go all in with that belief.  Maybe this works for one in a thousand people, but it is absolutely not guaranteed to work.

What is guaranteed, is that your idea of what's great is probably not identical to what others think is great.  You need to prod people, and cause them to cough up ideas for you.

The experiment gets your prospective customer to tell you what they want.

## Philosophical tangent

First of all, reading this book almost makes me feel very stupid, because the path to success seems, if not easy, at least absolutely clear.

But second, Kagan's ideas resonated with some ideas about the world that I keep coming back to.

I used to work for Lyndon LaRouche.  The core of all his writings, at least those since around 1980, revolve around a model he developed on how human minds interact with the rest of the universe.

LaRouche presents the concept of the "Theorem Lattice".  In Euclid's presentation of his Elements, you start with a set of axioms, postulates, and definitions.  Basically, assumptions taken for granted, from which all future theorems are derived.  For example, one of the postulates is that if two lines (A and B) cross a third (C), and the interior angles on one side of that third line add up to 180 degrees (= two right angles), then those two lines A and B will never meet.  In other words, they're parallel.  Later on in Book 1, Euclid uses this postulate to prove that the angles in a triangle will always add up to 180 degrees.

LaRouche says that a person's concept of the universe, or "world view", has the form of such a theorem lattice.  However, a person's world view is never an exact representation of the real universe.  So, in the case of an experiment, a person is comparing one theorem in his world view's lattice (a hypothesis), with what really happens in the universe.  If the result of the experiment doesn't equal the hypothesis, well then that person has to change his axioms!

For a geometry example, it was shown around the time of Karl Gauss that there are surfaces on which you can draw triangles whose angles don't add up to 180 degrees.  If you try to draw a big triangle on the Earth, with one corner at the North pole, and the other two on the equator, the sum of your angles will always be greater than 180 degrees.  So, that means the parallel postulate can't be true.

When you come up with a hot sales idea, and then act like that baby will sell like hotcakes, you're relying on a theorem derived from the basic assumptions of your world view.  When you go try to get someone to give you money for that product, you're challenging the real universe to either agree or disagree with your world view.  If you can't sell that product to anyone to save your soul, you've just proved you have some wrong axioms in your theorem lattice.

The special thing that we humans are equipped to do is to change our minds!  We can ditch the product idea and try something else!

Whether Kagan's system is underpinned by such deep philosophical/theological beliefs is not covered in his book.  But, the idea that you got to run repeated experiments, and use the feedback you get to design the followup experiments, implies this kind of world.
