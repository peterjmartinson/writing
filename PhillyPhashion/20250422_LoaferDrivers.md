Say what you saw on the train and at church.
Give three places to buy.


Office Casualties
=================

The wingtip-upper-sneaker-sole trend still has its ugly grip on Philadelphia's office couture throat, but there are signs of a rebellion.

Both at church Easter Sunday and on the R5 train into Center City today, I saw a new shoe starting to take hold.  Probably I recognized this a few years after everyone else, but there it is.  At home with both the apron toe and loafer moc...

The horse bit loafer.

This is a slimmed down, edgier version of the usual loafer we wear in the summer, adorned with a thin bar of metal or other solid matter across the top.  This morning at the train stop, I observed horse bit loafers (aka "hazel loafers") in leather and suede, colored brown, tan, gray, and purple, with bits made of metal and plastic.

So fashion forward, Philly!  Much better than the rebellious golf belt trend of 2024.

An alternate version spotted is the old apron toe loafer.

The dress sneaker still grips Philadelphia business casual by the throat, but there has been a glimmer of revolt recently.

The horse bit loafer.

My wife first noticed them at church Easter Sunday, because I'm typically oblivious to what people around me are wearing.  But now I see them on a few gentlemen on the R5 into center city.

What's the horse bit loafer?  First introduced by Gucci back around 1950, it looks a lot like a penny loafer.  In place of the penny holder strap, though, is a thin strip of metal.  It's reminiscent of the bridle bit held in a horse's mouth, which you can see during the May 7, 2025, Kentucky Derby.

The horse bit loafer I've seen on a few guys are more delicate than the usual leather loafer, and some are suede instead of the usual smooth leather.  Most are moccasin toe versions, but I've seen a few apron toes as well.  

They go great with chinos, though I bet you could pull off some dark denim.

Here are a few options if you want to get with it, and burn those old dress sneakers.
