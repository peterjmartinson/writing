subject:
Chinese Lunar Samples

Body:

Hi,

My name is Peter Martinson, and I run a blog at https://stonetelescope.wordpress.com.  I want to know how scientists in USA are getting along with the Chinese in studying their Chang'e-5 and Chang'e-6 lunar return samples.  LPI seems like the place to start my research!

Just so it's clear, I blasted this out to a bunch of emails I found on the /about/staff page, but everyone's BCC'ed, so only I'll know whether you responded, and what with.

I'm writing a series of articles on what we've learned about the Moon and the Solar System generally since China has returned those samples.  How has our understanding of the Moon and elsewhere changed since the first post-USSR sample return of 2020?  How has USA contributed to the research with these samples?  Is there anything we *hope* to learn, but the research is still in process?

Please feel free to share with me links to research papers or articles.

I'm a big fan of boots on the ground, so anything that smacks of "these samples are great, but wow, if we'd had a geologist up there, I wish they could have grabbed X!" is gold.

Also, I have some fans interested in politics.  Can you add any color on how the political climate (e.g. the US Wolf Amendment) affected US collaboration on this research?

Thank you so much for your time!  Please let me know if you'd be up for a phone call, which would be invaluable to me.

Kindest Regards,
Peter Martinson
