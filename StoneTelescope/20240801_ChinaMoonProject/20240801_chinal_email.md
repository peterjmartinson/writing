Warm Greetings from USA,

My name is Peter Martinson, I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the USA, and I run a small blog called [Stone Telescope](https://stonetelescope.wordpress.com).

I'm writing a series of articles on discoveries made since China started landing probes on the Moon, especially since the Chang'e-5 and 6 sample return missions.  I found your name attached to the article [The Moon's farside shallow subsurface structure unveiled by Chang'e-4 Lunar Pentetrating Radar] (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay6898), which is why you're getting my email.

If you have a few moments, I have a few questions:

1. Can you help me assemble a picture of how our knowledge of the Moon has changed since the Chang'e landers began their missions?  Please feel free to send me links to articles, books, or videos.

2. How has our view of physical processes changed, after studying the returned samples?

3. Has our knowledge of the history of the Solar System changed much?

4. Do you work with scientists in other countries?  If so, what are some ways that has been helped and hurt by laws and relationships between China and the other nations?

Any insights you can provide will be invaluable to me!

Thank you for your time,
Peter Martinson
