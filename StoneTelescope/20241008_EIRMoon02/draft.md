Where did the Moon Come From?
=============================

One day over a decade ago, I emailed the last man on the Moon, Senator Harrison Schmitt [[sp?]] of New Mexico, and asked him how the Moon formed.  After bashing "Red China" a bit, he responded all in caps:  "SATELLITE CAPTURE".

Not long after that, I met the great lunar scientist from UT-Knoxville, Larry Taylor.  When I told him what Senator Schmitt had said, Taylor responded, "Jack should know better than that: I taught the guy geology!  The Moon was formed when a Mars-sized bolide collided with the Earth."

This point-counterpoint nicely illustrates the uncertainty surrounding how the Moon was formed.  The third option often discussed is that both the Earth and the Moon formed at the same time, condensing from the same swirling mass of dust almost five billion years ago.

How could such massive uncertainty still follow this fundamental part of our Lunar knowledge?  Didn't we already go to the Moon and bring back some soil?  Don't we have a few spacecraft orbiting the satellite right now, with cameras?

This article is designed to describe our state of knowledge regarding the origin of our planetary companion, why it's important to figure out the truth, and why more boots on the moon is necessary to do so.
