Some future articles, once I'm done with this one.

1. Nearside Farside dichotomy.

Is this really an entire article?  You can certainly go through some of the theories and what the latest thoughts are.  And loop in whatever has been found out with the Chang'e-5 samples.

But, does that make for an entire article?

2. Lunar origin

Again, you really don't know much about this, except that there are three competing theories.

Lunar capture
Mars-sized impactor
Fraternal twins

What are the back and forth on these?  Any advances from recent missions?

3. ISRU?

Where is the water?  History of search for Water on Moon.
He-3?  This stuff's found in all the samples so far (really?)
Using the soil to build stuff?  Any missions doing this outside of using fake shit?

4. Politics, I guess?

What's the history and real effects of the Wolf Amendment?  History of relations between USA and China over space exploration?

Maybe use USSR-USA as a case study of how this can be done?

5. Age of the solar system, history of events?

Describe the early bombardment period
How is crater counting really done?
What are some conclusions from elsewhere in the solar system, that depend on Lunar craters?

6.  Just regular updates on new research on the Moon

The point here is, keep up the pressure to think about colonization
