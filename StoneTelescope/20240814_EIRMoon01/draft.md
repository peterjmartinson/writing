The New Lunar Astronomy
=======================

If the 1960s were characterized by a space race of crash programs to get boots on the Moon, the first quarter of the 21st Century can be characterized as a steady march back to the Moon, to stay.  The march this time has been led, not by the US and Russia, but rather by the US and China, and supported by a group of other nations not traditionally known as space powers, like India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and even Mexico.  The race is also joined by a phalanx of private space companies mainly in the USA, but also in India and China.

The focus is the Lunar south pole, which is home to the largest meteor impact basin anywhere in the Solar System.  This basin contains several craters that are deep enough to be permanently shadowed, and that have given us hints that they have water ice.

An extremely important milestone was reached in July 2024.  China's Chang'e-6 mission has returned to Earth with the first rock and soil samples taken from the Lunar far side.  Two years previous, China's Chang'e-5 mission returned the first Lunar samples since the USSR Luna 24 mission in 1976.  Chang'e-5 samples have already been distributed to scientists around the world for analysis.  Chinese scientists are right now performing preliminary analyses of the Chang'e-6 far side samples, with the intent to release them to the broader science community soon.

In this article, I'll present a brief survey of what we know about the Moon, why it is important to Mankind's future, and how the most recent lunar missions work toward that future.  It is intended to be a summary article, and predecessor to a series of future articles that focus on various aspects of recent Lunar research.

Before getting to the meat, though, it's important to recognize that the current furor is not about getting people to Mars, but rather back to the Moon.  For many years leading up to around the 2016 election of President Trump, a debate has raged about which planet to target first.  There are arguments that favor bypassing the Moon and heading straight to Mars, such as Robert Zubrin's Mars First program.

Lyndon LaRouche himself staked a position on this debate as early as his 1988 presidential election campaign, when he followed rocket pioneer Krafft Ehricke who reasoned that the Moon was the first, necessary stop in our voyage to Mars.  A sustainable presence in any non-maritime setting requires robust infrastructure.  On land, that means rail-centered development corridors, such as the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative has illustrated.

In space, that means sustainable ports with manufacturing capability along with established regular supply routes between planets.  The Moon is not only a stable base on which to build a growing set of stations and factories.  It can be reached within a few days in case of inevitable problems.  Its relatively small curvature of space-time will allow spacecraft to lift off and enter orbit with minimal expenditure of fuel.  It also provides a training ground for people learning to operate on an airless planetary surface.

In other words, colonies on the Moon represent a necessary piece of infrastructure on our way to colonizing the rest of our Solar System, including Mars.

It now appears that the Mars or Moon first debate has been decisively won.  We are going to the Moon first.

## What Is the Moon?

Let us first review just what the Moon is for Mankind.

Johannes Kepler demonstrated that the Creator of the universe organized His creation so we could learn how it all works.  Specifically, He gave us a permanent satellite, positioned in such a precise way that it serves as a sort of lens.

To the idiot, the Moon is a big ball of dead rock we've already been to.  To the rest of us, it is a scientific instrument.

It's just the right size and distance to sometimes produce an exact solar eclipse.  Eclipses have long produced a powerful need to look to the cosmos.  These events also helped Aristarchus to make the first determination of the distances between Sun, Earth, and Moon.  But there are other qualities that make the Moon useful for us.

One side always points away from the Earth.  Because of this, radio and other telescopes can be constructed on that far side, and be permanently shielded from all noise broadcast from the Earth.  There is no other exposed place in the Solar System that is always shielded form the Earth.

It is the closest object to the Sun without either a magnetic field or atmosphere.  This made the Moon the first target of fusion scientists from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, led by Gerald Kulcinski <sp?>, who sought helium-3 to power the most favorable fusion reactions.  He and collaborators calculated the Moon has at least 500 million metric tons of Helium-3, because it has been collecting this isotope from the Solar wind for the past several billion years.  When they analyzed returned lunar samples, they found He-3 in every one

The Moon also serves as the Solar System's timekeeper.  Because it has been (suspected to be) relatively inert since its surface lava flows solidified, it preserves a record of meteorite impacts that goes back almost to the earliest days of the Solar System.  Astronomers have developed a technique called crater density analysis where they can determine how the rate of bombardment has changed over the past 4 billion years.  We use this method to figure out when certain events happened on other planets.  This, combined with absolute dates extracted from returned Lunar samples, has given us a way to match events in the evolution of life with cosmic events.

## The Great Dichotomy

The Moon rotates at the same speed it orbits Earth - it is _tidally locked_.  In other words, the Moon always faces the same side at the Earth.  We never get to see the other side.  In fact, we had _no_ idea what the other side looked like until the Soviet Luna 3 space probe photographed it in 1960.

What we found was surprising.

The near side exhibits what some call the "Man in the Moon".  This is really a collection of relatively smooth surfaces called Mare, almost certainly created by molten lava flows on the surface.  Those Mare are broken up by the lunar Highlands, which are more brightly colored and rougher texture, pockmarked by many craters.

The far side, in contrast, contains almost no Mare.  The landscape looks like a regular planetary surface pocked by meteor impact craters.  In fact, the only mare found on the far side are inside an incredibly large impact crater, called the South-Pole Aitkin Basin (SPA).  This crater is the largest impact structure known in the Solar System.

At the moment, nobody knows why there is such a distinction between the two sides.  Some ideas appear to be more plausible than others, but there are reasons not to believe all of them.  Like all other dramatic planetary events, it is most likely due to a combination of factors.  

For example, perhaps the tidal locking occurred early in the Moon's history, while it was still relatively molten.  The resultant centripetal force may have driven early solidified rock to the far side, which resulted in a thicker crust there.  When the Late Heavy Bombardment began, it was then easier for meteorites to punch through the thinner crust on the near side, and cause lava to spew onto the surface

One reason this may not be the reason is that the meteorite that slammed into the far side of the Moon and created the SPA Basin should easily have punched through even a thickened far side crust, and released any pent-up magma.  The actual mare that formed in this massive crater, however, do not add up to the amount of outflow expected.

To really understand what could have happened requires microsopic investigation of samples from the surface of the far side.  For now, the only scientists with such a sample in hand are in China.

## Chronology

Early in the history of our Solar System, there was a great vacuuming up of interplanetary debris.  We know this, not because we were there, but because we see the impact craters from this period preserved on the lunar surface.

Scientists can determine relative ages of craters by indications that one crater lies on top of another one


## The New Race

Though various parties may say there is not a new Moon race, it's on.

On the one side is China.  China first began making strides toward the Moon back in 2007 [[???]].  Back then, before the United States congress passed a National Defense Authorization with the now infamous Wolf Amendment (more below), China sent several emissaries from the Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) to study how NASA got to the Moon.  China's space program had begun using NASA mission architecture (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo) along with Russian spacecraft design, and succeeded in building what is currently the world's most robust national space program in the world.

On the other side is the United States of America.  After NASA succeeded in getting boots on the Moon, the awful decision was made by "Congratulations, you are the last men to step on the moon" Nixon's administration to put most space funding into the incredibly expensive Space Shuttle program.  Thus precipitated the transition from an exploration-focused NASA to one focused on robotic science.  Only during the two post-Clinton Republican presidencies has this status quo been challenged, first with President Bush's Constellation program (significantly cut by President Obama), and then with President Trump's Artemis program.

Auxiliary to the renewed national focus on the Moon, is a rapid proliferation of private American companies that can launch astronauts into space, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.

The two sides of this race is represented by the two national programs, but also by two international Lunar agreement frameworks.

On the Western side, the Trump administration created the Artemis Accords, an update on the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that clarifies aspects like usage of Lunar resources.  Creation of these accords coincided with the announcement of the NASA Artemis Program, which aims to land astronauts on the moon by 2026.  Over 45 nations have signed the accords, including India, the fourth nation to successfully land on the Moon.

On the Eastern side, China and Russia signed the International Lunar Research Station agreement in June 2021.  This agreement is centered around the Chinese plan to build a research base near the Moon's south pole.  The program includes all the Chang'e probes and landers, as well as Russia's renewed Luna program.  Since 2021, the agreement has been written into Russian law, and attracted signatures from 10 [[[???]]] other countries.

## The Missions

1. Artemis

The United States most recently landed a craft on the Lunar surface in February 2024.  This is the first time USA has landed on our satellite since Apollo 17, over 50 years ago.  This mission, called Intuitive Machines 1 (Odysseus), was a demonstration of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Service (CLPS) program.  The idea is that the US will employ a form of public-private partnership to get back to the Moon - NASA will provide funding, mission planning, and coordination, along with some technology (like the Space Launch System), while private space companies will provide the bulk of the technology.

Other signatories of the Artemis Accords that have successfully landed on the Moon include Japan, who landed the Smart Lander in January 2024, and most importantly India, whose successful _Chandrayaan-3_ mission included an orbiter, lander, and rover.

Another significant milestone was reached in 2022, when NASA launched the _Artemis I_, a fully operational SLS rocket with Orion crew capsule up top, which flew to the Lunar orbit and splashed down again in the Atlantic Ocean.  This was an unmanned mission, designed to test all the components necessary to deliver astronauts to Lunar orbit and return them safely to the Earth.

The United States and India currently operate several spacecraft that orbit the Moon.  These include NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), whose maps form the foundation for all the Lunar missions of the 21st Century.  This also includes ISRO's Chandrayaan-1, which was the first craft to find unambiguous traces of water ice in the southern craters.

2. The Orient

China has had incredible success over the past two decades with the Moon.  CNSA first landed softly on the Moon back in 2013 with the Chang'e-3 mission.  This was followed in 2019 with the Chang'e-4 mission, which not only was the first craft to land on the far side of the Moon, but also carried a rover, _Yutu_ (Jade Rabbit), that operated for several days.  One year later, Chang'e-5 landed on the Lunar near side, deployed a still functioning rover (_Yutu-2_), and also successfully sent almost 2 kg of Lunar soil back to the Earth.  This is the first sample returned since the Soviet Luna-24 lander back in 1976.  Finally, Chang'e-6 landed on the far side in mid-2024, and also returned samples to the Earth.

Though Russia has a long history of successful space missions, they have yet to repeat these successes a half-century later.  Their Luna-25 mission deployed a lander within days of the arrival of India's Chandrayaan-3, but the lander crashed on impact.

## The Future

At the moment, it looks to this author like China will win the race to get people back to the Moon first.  The current plans, which blah blah.

## Conclusion

The Moon is our cosmic launch pad.   blah blah
