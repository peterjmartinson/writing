The New Lunar Astronomy
=======================

If the 1960s were characterized by a space race of crash programs to get boots on the Moon, the first quarter of the 21st Century can be characterized as a steady march back to the Moon, to stay.  The march this time has been led, not by the US and Russia, but rather by the US and China, and supported by a group of other nations not traditionally known as space powers, like India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and even Mexico.  The race is also joined by a phalanx of private space companies mainly in the USA, but also in India and China.

The focus is the Lunar south pole, which is home to the largest meteor impact basin anywhere in the Solar System.  As this basin may contain a vast reservoir of Lunar water, it is the target of Humanity's first permanent extraterrestrial settlements.

An extremely important milestone was reached in July 2024.  China's Chang'e-6 mission has returned to Earth with the first rock and soil samples taken from the Lunar far side.  Two years previous, China's Chang'e-5 mission returned the first Lunar samples since the USSR Luna 24 mission in 1975 [???].  Chang'e-5 samples have already been distributed to scientists around the world for analysis.  Chinese scientists are right now performing preliminary analyses of the Chang'e-6 far side samples, with the intent to release them to the broader science community soon.

What will we find?

In this article, I'll present a brief survey of what we know about the Moon, why it's important to Mankind's future, and how the most recent lunar missions work toward that future.

Before getting to the meat, though, it's important to note the focus on getting human boots onto the surface of the Moon, and not Mars.  For many years leading up to around the 2016 election of President Trump, a debate has raged about which planet to target first.  There are arguments that favor bypassing the Moon and heading straight to Mars, such as [[name]] Zubrin's Mars First program.

Lyndon LaRouche himself staked a position on this debate as early as his 1986 presidential election, when he and rocket pioneer Krafft Ehricke reasoned that the Moon was the first, necessary stop in our voyage to Mars.  A sustainable presence in any non-maritime setting requires robust infrastructure.  On land, that means rail-centered development corridors, such as the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative has illustrated.

In space, that means sustainable ports with manufacturing capability along with established regular supply routes between planets.  The Moon is a stable base on which to build a growing set of stations and factories.  In case of inevitable problems, it can be reached within a few days.  Its relatively small curvature of spacetime will allow spacecraft to enter orbit with minimal expenditure of fuel.  It also provides a training ground for learning to operate on an airless planetary surface.

It now appears that the Mars or Moon first debate has been decisively won.  We are going to the Moon first.

## What Is the Moon?

Johannes Kepler demonstrated that the Creator of the universe organized His creation so we could learn how it all works.  Specifically, He gave us a permanent satellite, positioned in such a precise way that it serves as a sort of lens.

To the idiot, the Moon is a big ball of dead rock we've already been to.  To the rest of us, it is a scientific instrument.

It's just the right size and distance to sometimes produce an exact solar eclipse.  Eclipses have long produced a powerful need to look to the cosmos.  These events also helped Aristarchus to make the first determination of the distances between Sun, Earth, and Moon.  But there are other qualities that make the Moon useful for us.

One side always points away from the Earth.  Because of this, radio and other telescopes can be constructed on that far side, and be permanently shielded from all noise broadcast from the Earth.  There is no other exposed place in the Solar System that is always shielded form the Earth.

It is the closest object to the Sun without either a magnetic field or atmosphere.  This made the Moon the first target of fusion scientists from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, led by Robert Kulchinski <sp?>, who sought helium-3 to power the most favorable fusion reactions.  The Moon is thought to collect massive amounts of helium-3 from the solar wind as it swings around Earth.

The Moon also serves as the Solar System's timekeeper.  Because it has been (suspected to be) relatively inert since its surface lava flows solidified, it preserves a record of meteorite impacts that goes back almost to the earliest days of the Solar System.  Astronomers have developed a technique called crater density analysis where they can determine how the rate of bombardment has changed over the past 4 billion years.  We use this method to figure out when certain events happened on other planets.  This, combined with absolute dates extracted from returned Lunar samples, has given us a way to match events in the evolution of life with cosmic events.

## The Great Dichotomy

The Moon rotates at the same speed it orbits Earth - it is _tidally locked_.  In other words, the Moon always faces the same side at the Earth.  We never get to see the other side.  In fact, we had _no_ idea what the other side looked like until the Soviet Luna 3 space probe photographed it in 1960.

What we found was surprising.

The near side exhibits what some call the "Man in the Moon".  This is really a collection of relatively smooth surfaces called Mare, almost certainly created by molten lava flows on the surface.  Those Mare are broken up by the lunar Highlands, which are more brightly colored and rougher texture, pockmarked by many craters.

The far side, in contrast, contains almost no Mare.  The landscape looks like a regular planetary surface pocked by meteor impact craters.  In fact, the only mare found on the far side are inside an incredibly large impact crater, called the South-Pole Aitkin Basin (SPA).  This crater is the largest impact structure known in the Solar System.

At the moment, nobody knows why there is such a distinction between the two sides.  Some ideas appear to be more plausible than others, but there are reasons not to believe all of them.  Like all other dramatic planetary events, it is most likely due to a combination of factors.  

For example, perhaps the tidal locking occurred early in the Moon's history, while it was still relatively molten.  The resultant centripetal force may have driven early solidified rock to the far side, which resulted in a thicker crust there.  When the Late Heavy Bombardment began, it was then easier for meteorites to punch through the thinner crust on the near side, and cause lava to spew onto the surface

One reason this may not be the reason is that the meteorite that slammed into the far side of the Moon and created the SPA Basin should easily have punched through even a thickened far side crust, and released any pent-up magma.  The actual mare that formed in this massive crater, however, do not add up to the amount of outflow expected.

To really understand what could have happened requires microsopic investigation of samples from the surface of the far side.  For now, the only scientists with such a sample in hand are in China.

## Chronology

Early in the history of our Solar System, there was a great vacuuming up of interplanetary debris.  We know this, not because we were there, but because we see the impact craters from this period preserved on the lunar surface.

Scientists can determine relative ages of craters by indications that one crater lies on top of another one
