The New Lunar Astronomy
=======================

If the 1960s were characterized by a space race of crash programs to get boots on the Moon, the first quarter of the 21st Century can be characterized as a steady march back to the Moon, to stay.  The march this time has been led, not by the US and Russia, but rather by the US and China, and supported by a group of other nations not traditionally known as space powers, like India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and even Mexico.  The race is also joined by a phalanx of private space companies mainly in the USA, but also in India and China.

The focus is the Lunar south pole, which is home to the largest meteor impact basin anywhere in the Solar System.  This basin contains several craters that are deep enough to be permanently shadowed, and that have given us hints that they have water ice.

An extremely important milestone was reached in July 2024.  China's Chang'e-6 mission has returned to Earth with the first rock and soil samples taken from the Lunar far side.  Two years previous, China's Chang'e-5 mission returned the first Lunar samples since the USSR Luna 24 mission in 1976.  Chang'e-5 samples have already been distributed to scientists around the world for analysis.  Chinese scientists are right now performing preliminary analyses of the Chang'e-6 far side samples, with the intent to release them to the broader science community soon.

In this article, I'll present a brief survey of what we know about the Moon, why it is important to Mankind's future, and how the most recent lunar missions work toward that future.  It is intended to be a summary article, and predecessor to a series of future articles that focus on various aspects of recent Lunar research.

Before getting to the meat, though, it's important to recognize that the current furor is not about getting people to Mars, but rather back to the Moon.  For many years leading up to around the 2016 election of President Trump, a debate has raged about which planet to target first.  There are arguments that favor bypassing the Moon and heading straight to Mars, such as Robert Zubrin's Mars First program.

Lyndon LaRouche himself staked a position on this debate as early as his 1988 presidential election campaign, when he followed rocket pioneer Krafft Ehricke who reasoned that the Moon was the first, necessary stop in our voyage to Mars.  A sustainable presence in any non-maritime setting requires robust infrastructure.  On land, that means rail-centered development corridors, such as the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative has illustrated.

In space, that means sustainable ports with manufacturing capability along with established regular supply routes between planets.  The Moon is not only a stable base on which to build a growing set of stations and factories.  It can be reached within a few days in case of inevitable problems.  Its relatively small curvature of space-time will allow spacecraft to lift off and enter orbit with minimal expenditure of fuel.  It also provides a training ground for people learning to operate on an airless planetary surface.

In other words, colonies on the Moon represent a necessary piece of infrastructure on our way to colonizing the rest of our Solar System, including Mars.

It now appears that the Mars or Moon first debate has been decisively won.  We are going to the Moon first.

## What Is the Moon?

Let us first review just what the Moon is for Mankind.

Johannes Kepler demonstrated that the Creator of the universe organized His creation so we could learn how it all works.  Specifically, He gave us a permanent satellite, positioned in such a precise way that it serves as a sort of lens.

To the idiot, the Moon is a big ball of dead rock we've already been to.  To the rest of us, it is a _scientific instrument_.  It's just the right size and distance to sometimes produce an exact solar eclipse.  Eclipses have long produced within people a powerful need to look to the cosmos.  This serendipity also allowed Aristarchus to make the first determination of the distances between Sun, Earth, and Moon.  But there are other qualities that make it useful for us.

One side always points away from the Earth.  Because of this, radio and other telescopes can be constructed on that far side, and be permanently shielded from all noise broadcast from the Earth.  Nowhere else in the universe has such a property.

It is the closest object to the Sun without either a magnetic field or atmosphere.  This made the Moon the first target of fusion scientists from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, led by Gerald Kulcinski <sp?>, who sought helium-3 to power the most favorable fusion reactions.  He and collaborators calculated the Moon has at least 500 million metric tons of Helium-3, because it has been collecting this isotope from the Solar wind for the past several billion years.  When they analyzed returned lunar samples, they found He-3 in every one

The Moon also serves as the Solar System's timekeeper.  Because it has been (suspected to be) relatively inert since its surface lava flows solidified, it preserves a record of meteorite impacts that goes back almost to the earliest days of the Solar System.  Astronomers have developed a technique called crater density analysis where they can determine how the rate of bombardment has changed over the past 4 billion years.  We use this method to figure out when certain events happened on other planets.  This, combined with absolute dates extracted from returned Lunar samples, has given us a way to match events in the evolution of life with cosmic events.
