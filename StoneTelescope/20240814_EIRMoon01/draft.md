The New Lunar Astronomy
=======================

If the 1960s were characterized by a space race of crash programs to get boots on the Moon, the first quarter of the 21st Century can be characterized as a steady march back to the Moon, to stay.  The march this time has been led, not by the US and Russia, but rather by the US and China, and supported by a group of other nations not traditionally known as space powers, like India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and even Mexico.  The focus is narrowing down to the Lunar south pole, which is home to the largest meteor impact basin anywhere in the Solar System.  As this basin may contain a vast reservoir of Lunar water, it is the target of Humanity's first permanent extraterrestrial settlements.

An extremely important milestone was reached in July 2024.  China's Chang'e-6 mission has returned to Earth with the first rock and soil samples taken from the Lunar far side.  Two years previous, China's Chang'e-5 mission returned the first Lunar samples since the USSR Luna 24 mission in 1975 [???].  Chinese scientists are right now performing preliminary surveys of these far side samples, with the intent to release them to the broader science community soon.

What will we find?

This article will present a survey of Lunar knowledge...
