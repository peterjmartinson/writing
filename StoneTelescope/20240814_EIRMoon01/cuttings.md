## The Great Dichotomy

The Moon rotates at the same speed it orbits Earth - it is _tidally locked_.  In other words, the Moon always faces the same side at the Earth.  We never get to see the other side.  In fact, we had _no_ idea what the other side looked like until the Soviet Luna 3 space probe photographed it in 1960.

What we found was surprising.

The near side exhibits what some call the "Man in the Moon".  This is really a collection of relatively smooth surfaces called Mare, almost certainly created by molten lava flows on the surface.  Those Mare are broken up by the lunar Highlands, which are more brightly colored and rougher texture, pockmarked by many craters.

The far side, in contrast, contains almost no Mare.  The landscape looks like a regular planetary surface pocked by meteor impact craters.  In fact, the only mare found on the far side are inside an incredibly large impact crater, called the South-Pole Aitkin Basin (SPA).  This crater is the largest impact structure known in the Solar System.

At the moment, nobody knows why there is such a distinction between the two sides.  Some ideas appear to be more plausible than others, but there are reasons not to believe all of them.  Like all other dramatic planetary events, it is most likely due to a combination of factors.  

For example, perhaps the tidal locking occurred early in the Moon's history, while it was still relatively molten.  The resultant centripetal force may have driven early solidified rock to the far side, which resulted in a thicker crust there.  When the Late Heavy Bombardment began, it was then easier for meteorites to punch through the thinner crust on the near side, and cause lava to spew onto the surface

One reason this may not be the reason is that the meteorite that slammed into the far side of the Moon and created the SPA Basin should easily have punched through even a thickened far side crust, and released any pent-up magma.  The actual mare that formed in this massive crater, however, do not add up to the amount of outflow expected.

To really understand what could have happened requires microsopic investigation of samples from the surface of the far side.  For now, the only scientists with such a sample in hand are in China.

## Chronology

Early in the history of our Solar System, there was a great vacuuming up of interplanetary debris.  We know this, not because we were there, but because we see the impact craters from this period preserved on the lunar surface.

Scientists can determine relative ages of craters by indications that one crater lies on top of another one
