A new paper has come out that concerns Earth's passage through the Local Bubble.  Most recently I've reviewed evidence of supernova events that may have occurred 2-10 Myr near the Earth, as found in both [ocean sediments](LINK) and in [fossil magnetite](LINK) made by ancient bacteria.  One intriguing question is whether these events had anything to do with the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene eras of Earth's history, which also happened around 2.6 Myr ago.

This new paper investigates the theory that Earth passed through dense interstellar clouds around 2-3 million years ago, and how that would have affected both the Sun's magnetosphere and the Earth's environment.  The paper is called _A possible direct exposure of the Earth to the cold dense interstellar medium 2-3 Myr ago_, and it was composed by Merav Opher, Abraham Loeb, and J. E. G. Peek.

I'll give a short summary of the theory they present, a description of some of their methods, and then a discussion of the significance of the paper.  As usual, the abstract is down [below](LINK).

## Main Idea

The Earth is currently passing through a region of interstellar space that doesn't have a lot of stuff in it.  This region is called the Local Bubble, and nobody really knows how it was formed, though supernova events are the typical suspects.

The paper describes a few clouds of denser matter floating around in this void, and investigates the possibility that we passed through at least one of these in the past.  

Typically, the sun's heliosphere [shields](LINK - svensmark/shaviv) the Earth from Cosmic Rays.  If the Earth were to find itself outside of the heliosphere, its bare ass would get pummeled by cosmic rays and other matter typically diverted by the Sun's strong magnetic field.  The authors suggest this is exactly what may have happened.

## What they actually did

The authors really did two things reported by the paper:

1. They estimated the probability our Solar System passed through one of the clouds

2. They performed numerical modeling to determine how the Sun's heliosphere would have reacted to passing through the cloud.

### Did we pass through a cloud?

Opher et al. identify one major collection of cold, dense clouds called the Local Ribbon of Cold Clouds (LRCC), and within this complex, the largest component called the Local Leo Cold Cloud (LLCC) and the Local Lynx of Cold Clouds (LxCC).  Why treat the constellation Lynx as the name of a group instead of an object?  This is left as a mystery for the reader.

What is not left to conjecture, is that LxCC is more massive than LLCC, and makes up more than half the mass of the whole LRCC.  Opher et al. model the motion of the whole LRCC as a solid, nonrotating object traveling at 14.1 km/s roughly towards the constellation Auriga.  Somehow (it's not that clear), the authors calculate that due to dhis velocity, and due to estimated sizes of the LxCC, there is at least a 1.3% chance the solar system  passed through this cloud.

Seems like a low probability.  However, the authors also suggest, due to some Monte Carlo models, that the clouds may have been somewhat larger 2-3 Mya, and that we really don't know how these clouds change over time.  So, the actual probability may have been much higher than a 1.3% chance.

### If we did, how did the heliosphere react?



After some numerical modeling ("the most advanced modeling software ever"), the authors show that the gas pressure of the clouds would have compressed the Sun's magnetic field ("Heliosphere") down to a radius smaller than Mercury's orbit.



There might be some protection offered by our own magnetic field, and the authors do try to judge that effect.((


One effect the authors point to, as possible evidence of this onset of solar nakedness, is the presence of supernova generated 60-Fe and ???-Pb in ocean sediment and biological fossils.





Some readers may note that Loeb has been in the news a lot since about 2018.  Back then, he suggested the first observed interstellar comet, O'muamua, could have been an abandoned stellar sail built by extraterrestrials.
