A new paper has come out that is related to Earth's passage through the Local Bubble.  Most recently I've reviewed evidence of supernova events that may have occurred 2-10 Myr near the Earth, as found in both [ocean sediments](LINK) and in [fossil magnetite](LINK) made by ancient bacteria.  One intriguing quesion is whether these events had anything to do with the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene eras of Earth's history, which also happened around 2.6 Myr ago.

This new paper investigates the theory that Earth passed through dense interstellar clouds around 2-3 million years ago, and how that would have affected both the Sun's magnetosphere and the Earth's environment.  The paper is called _A possible direct exposure of the Earth to the cold dense interstellar medium 2-3 Myr ago_, and it was composed by Merav Opher, Abraham Loeb, and J. E. G. Peek.

I'll give a short summary of the theory they present, a description of some of their methods, and then a discussion of the significance of the paper.  As usual, the abstract is down [below](LINK).

## Main Idea

The Earth is currently passing through a region of interstellar space that doesn't have a lot of stuff in it.  That means, not a lot of gas or dust.  This region is called the Local Bubble, and nobody really knows how it was formed.  We know it's a big void, because we can see other regions that are dense with matter.



Some readers may note that Loeb has been in the news a lot since about 2018.  Back then, he suggested the first observed interstellar comet, O'muamua, could have been an abandoned stellar sail built by extraterrestrials.
