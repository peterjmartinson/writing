A new paper has come out that is related to Earth's passage through the Local Bubble.  Most recently I've reviewed evidence of supernova events that may have occurred 2-10 Myr near the Earth, as found in both [ocean sediments](LINK) and in [fossil magnetite](LINK) made by ancient bacteria.  One intriguing quesion is whether these events had anything to do with the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene eras of Earth's history, which also happened around 2.6 Myr ago.

This new paper investigates the theory that Earth passed through dense interstellar clouds around 2-3 million years ago, and how that would have affected both the Sun's magnetosphere and the Earth's environment.  The paper is called _A possible direct exposure of the Earth to the cold dense interstellar medium 2-3 Myr ago_, and it was composed by Merav Opher, Abraham Loeb, and J. E. G. Peek.

I'll give a short summary of the theory they present, a description of some of their methods, and then a discussion of the significance of the paper.  As usual, the abstract is down [below](LINK).

## Main Idea

The Earth is currently passing through a region of interstellar space that doesn't have a lot of stuff in it.  This region is called the Local Bubble, and nobody really knows how it was formed.  The paper describes a few clouds of denser matter floating around in this void, and investigates the possibility that we passed through at least one of these in the past.  

After some numerical modelling ("the most advanced modeling software ever"), the authors show that the gas pressure of the clouds would have compressed the Sun's magnetic field ("Heliosphere") down to a radius smaller than Mercury's orbit.

Typically, the Earth is protected from cosmic debris like Cosmic Rays by the heliosphere.  If the Earth were to find itself outside of the heliosphere, it's bare ass would get pummeled by cosmic rays and other material, such as debris from supernova events.  There might be some protection offered by our own magnetic field, and the authors do try to judge that effect.o

One effect the authors point to, as possible evidence of this onset of solar nakedness, is the presense of supernova generated 60-Fe and ???-Pb in ocean sediment and biological fossils.

## Where are these clouds?

How we know we're in a bubble, the dimensions of said bubble, and the locations and sizes of the cold dense clouds is not easy to answer.  In general, astronomers use absorption spectra to determine these things.  For example, say we have two stars that appear pretty close together, Alpha and Beta.  The stars do not have signs that say "I am 200 parsecs away from you, sucker!"  And, there is no carpernter's laser to get the distance.  We have to use indirect measurements, like parallax or luminosity.  But let's say somene figured out the distances to Alpha and Beta, and Beta is further away from us than Alpha.

Now, let's say that star Alpha's spectrum looks nice and clean, just what we'd expect from that type of star.  But, star Beta's spectrum dims out unexpectedly at a few places.  One explanation of that dimming is that something, perhaps a cloud, is between us and Beta.  If we can map out exactly where that dimming takes place, we can determine what that cloud is made of.  And, if we compare that _absorption spectrum_ with standard chemical spectra gotten in a lab, we can determine the speed the cloud is moving towards or away from us.  That's the _Doppler shift_.

But the most important information we get is that the cloud is further away than star Alpha, and closer to us than star Beta.  We've bracketed the distance to the cloud.  Given enough radiant objects on either side of the cloud, we can get a rough idea of the shape of the cloud.

So, finding and characterizing these clouds requires a bit of serendipity.

That said, the authors look at two groups of these cold dense clouds, the [[AA]] and the [[BB]].  





Some readers may note that Loeb has been in the news a lot since about 2018.  Back then, he suggested the first observed interstellar comet, O'muamua, could have been an abandoned stellar sail built by extraterrestrials.
