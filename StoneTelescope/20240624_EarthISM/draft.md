How did the Earth get out?
==========================

A new paper has come out that concerns Earth's passage through the Local Bubble, [A possible direct exposure of the Earth to the cold dense interstellar medium 2–3 Myr ago](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02279-8).  Most recently I've reviewed evidence of supernova events that may have occurred 2-10 Myr near the Earth, as found in both [ocean sediments](https://stonetelescope.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/echoes-of-ancient-cataclysm-heard-through-ocean-rock/) and in [fossil magnetite](https://stonetelescope.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/echoes-of-ancient-cataclysm-heard-through-fossils/) made by ancient bacteria.  One intriguing question is whether these events had anything to do with the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene eras of Earth's history, which also happened around 2.6 Myr ago.

This new paper investigates the theory that Earth passed through dense interstellar clouds around 2-3 million years ago, and how that would have affected both the Sun's heliosphere and the Earth's environment.  The paper is called _A possible direct exposure of the Earth to the cold dense interstellar medium 2-3 Myr ago_, and it was composed by Merav Opher, Abraham Loeb, and J. E. G. Peek.

I'll give a short summary of the theory they present, a description of some of their methods, and then a discussion of the significance of the paper.  As usual, the abstract is down below.

## Main Idea

The Earth is currently passing through a region of interstellar space that doesn't have a lot of stuff in it.  This region is called the Local Bubble, and nobody really knows how it was formed, though supernova events are the typical suspects.

The paper describes a few clouds of denser matter floating around in this void, and investigates the possibility that we passed through at least one of these in the past.  

Typically, the Sun's heliosphere - the space that contains the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind - [shields](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117707002347?via%3Dihub) the Earth from Cosmic Rays.  If the Earth were to find itself outside of the heliosphere, its bare ass would get pummeled by cosmic rays and other matter typically diverted by the Sun's strong magnetic field.

The paper investigates whether this could have actually happened, what the effects would have been, and what evidence we might find to demonstrate it did happen.

## What they did

The authors actually did two things reported by the paper:

1. They estimated the probability our Solar System passed through one of the cold (T = 20K), dense (hydrogen atom density = 3000/cm-3) clouds

2. They performed numerical modeling to determine how the Sun's heliosphere would have reacted to passing through the cloud.

After that, they reviewed some other [recent](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature17196) [papers](https://doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1601040113) that link certain elements found in ocean floor sediment to this possible heliosphere-shrinkage-earth-pummeled event.

### Did we pass through a cloud?

Opher et al. identify one major collection of cold, dense clouds called the Local Ribbon of Cold Clouds (LRCC), and within this complex, the largest components called the Local Leo Cold Cloud (LLCC) and the Local Lynx of Cold Clouds (LxCC).  Why treat the word "Lynx" as a type of thing instead of the usual proper noun is left as a mystery for the reader to solve.

What is not left to conjecture, is that LxCC is more massive than LLCC, and makes up more than half the mass of the whole LRCC.  Opher et al. model the motion of the whole LRCC as a solid, non-rotating object traveling at 14.1 km/s roughly towards the constellation Auriga.  [density and temperature of the cloud]

Somehow (it's not that clear), the authors calculate that due to this velocity, and due to estimated sizes of the LxCC, there is at least a 1.3% chance the solar system  passed through this cloud.

Seems like a low probability.  However, the authors also suggest, due to some Monte Carlo models, that the clouds may have been somewhat larger 2-3 Mya, and that we really don't know how these clouds change over time.  So, the actual probability may have been much higher than a 1.3% chance.

### How would the heliosphere react?

Opher et al. use a numerical model to study the effects on our solar environment when we pass through a cloud like those in LxCC.  They assume, according to other [research](ref 8), that the clouds have a neutral hydrogen density of about $n_H = 3000 cm^{-3}$ and temperature of about 20K.  Compare that with the current Local Bubble environment of the Sun with $n_H = 0.2 cm^{-3}$ and T = 8000K.  Hence, "cold, dense clouds".

Their model shows that the Sun's heliosphere becomes dramatically compressed in the direction of motion, and dramatically elongated in the opposite direction - like if you stick your finger in the water while traveling on a boat.  The heliosphere on the compressed side, which is bounded by the _termination shock_, is smashed down to around 1/10 the mean distance between Sun and Earth (Astronomical Units, AU).  On the trailing side, the heliosphere was stretched out to several AU.

At the leading side of the heliosphere, neutral atoms (not affected by magnetic fields) got clumped together in densities exceeding $10,000 cm^{-3}$ and heated to more than 10,000K.

The main point of their model is that ALL the planets, including Mercury, would find themselves outside the solar heliosphere for a significant fraction of their orbital periods.  And, the transition would take around 40 Earth years to happen - at least, they ran the simulation for 44 model years.

### And, the Earth?

Evidence that this may have happened, according to the authors, may be found in ocean sediments.  Specifically, in two isotopes, Iron-60 ($^60Fe$) and Lead-244 ($^244Pb$).

As discussed [here](https://stonetelescope.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/echoes-of-ancient-cataclysm-heard-through-ocean-rock/) before, $^60Fe$ found in ocean sediment may be a signal preserved from nearby supernova events that occurred 2-3 Mya.  Opher et al. cite [these guys](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature17425) for having shown that $^244Pb$ likely formed during neutron star mergers (the kind that cause observable gravitational waves!).  $^60Fe$ has a half life of about 2.6 Myr, and $^244Pb$ about 80.7 Myr.

There's some discussion here about where the supernovae could have happened (10 pc or 100 pc away from Earth)?  There's somewhat less discussion about whether the $^60Fe$ needed to be locked into interstellar dust grains to actually get to the Earth's surface.  But, they fully agree that delivery of both isotopes required the drastic compression of the heliosphere that they model.

## Discussion

The discussion quickly gets quite far reaching quite quickly, but mostly centers around the kind of climate change Earth would have experienced while getting its ozone layer torn off by the Local Lynx.  One implication is that the evolution of human cognition may have been driven by the need to adapt to such rapid climate change around 2-3 million years ago.

Some of the discussion about the deposition of iron and lead isotopes was pretty convoluted in my view.  I also thought the probability of our having passed through a cloud ("greater than 1.3%") was pretty slim.  It's funny that the authors appear to detract from their own conclusion at the end of the paper.

That said, this is the kind of research that expands our ideas of what is possible in our universe.  We need _more_, not less of these kinds of theoretical studies.  Please read it and tell the authors you appreciate them!

## Abstract

Cold, dense clouds in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy are 4–5 orders of magnitude denser than their diffuse counterparts. Our Solar System has most likely encountered at least one of these dense clouds during its lifetime. However, evidence for such an encounter has not been studied in detail yet. Here we derive the velocity field of the Local Ribbon of Cold Clouds (LRCC) by modelling the 21 cm data from the HI4PI survey, finding that the Solar System may have passed through the LRCC in the constellation Lynx 2–3 million years ago. Using a state-of-the-art simulation of the heliosphere, we show that during the passage, the heliosphere shrinks to a scale of 0.22 au, smaller than the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. This would have put the Earth in direct contact with the dense interstellar medium for a period of time and exposed it to a neutral hydrogen density above 3,000 cm−3. Such a scenario agrees with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. The encounter and related increased radiation from Galactic cosmic rays might have had a substantial impact on the Earth’s system and climate.
