Hi,

My name is Peter Martinson, and I run a small blog at https://stonetelescope.wordpress.com.

I'm writing an article on your recent paper in _Nature Astronomy_ called "A possible direct exposure of the Earth to the cold dense interstellar medium 2-3 Myr ago".  If you have a few moments, I would like to ask a few questions.

1. How did you come up with the main idea here, that the solar system passed through a Local Bubble cloud and the heliosphere got compressed?

2. It seems like you state the SS had at least a 1.3% chance of passing through the LxCC ~2 Mya, but the only other place I see 1.3% is in this sentence: We found that the 1-sigma error region of the direction of flow of these clouds covers 1.3% of the sky, including the tail of the LRCC itself.  How does 1.3% of the sky turn into 1.3% chance of us having passed through the cloud?

3. May I reproduce the images in your paper?  I'll of course include proper attribution.

Please note that, unless you say otherwise, I may quote some of your response in the final blog post.

Thank you,
Peter Martinson
