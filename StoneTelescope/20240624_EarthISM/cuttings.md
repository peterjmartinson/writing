## Where are these clouds?

How we know we're in a bubble, the dimensions of said bubble, and the locations and sizes of the cold dense clouds is not easy to answer.  In general, astronomers use absorption spectra to determine these things.  For example, say we have two stars that appear to our eyes as close together, Alpha and Beta.  How do we know how far away they are?  The stars do not have signs that say "I am 200 parsecs away from you, sucker!"  And, there is no carpenter's laser to get the distance.  We have to use indirect measurements, like parallax or luminosity.  But let's say someone figured out the distances to Alpha and Beta, and Beta is further away from us than Alpha.

Now, let's say that star Alpha's spectrum looks nice and clean, just what we'd expect from that type of star.  But, star Beta's spectrum dims out unexpectedly at a few places.  One explanation of that dimming is that something, perhaps a cloud, is between us and Beta.  If we can map out exactly where that dimming takes place, we can determine what that cloud is made of.  And, if we compare that _absorption spectrum_ with standard chemical spectra gotten in a lab, we can determine the speed the cloud is moving towards or away from us.  That's the _Doppler shift_.

But the most important information we get is that the cloud is further away than star Alpha, and closer to us than star Beta.  We've bracketed the distance to the cloud.  Given enough radiant objects on either side of the cloud, we can get a rough idea of the shape of the cloud.

So, finding and characterizing these clouds requires a bit of serendipity.

That said, the authors look at two groups of these cold dense clouds, the [[AA]] and the [[BB]].  

Some of the discussion about the deposition of iron and lead isotopes was pretty convoluted in my view.  I also thought the probability of our having passed through a cloud ("greater than 1.3%") was pretty slim.  It's funny that the authors appear to detract from their own conclusion at the end of the paper.

That said, this is the kind of research that expands our ideas of what is possible in our universe.  We need _more_, not less of these kinds of theoretical studies.  Please read it and tell the authors you appreciate them!
