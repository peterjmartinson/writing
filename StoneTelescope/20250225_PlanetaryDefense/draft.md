How Carl Gauss Will Save Us From Extinction
===========================================

News has been ablaze recently with impending catastrophe.  A juggernaut is coming straight for us, all of us.  And unless we act now, we have no hope of survival.

No, we're not talking about President Trump here.  We're talking about an asteroid.

Asteroid 2024 YR4 was discovered during late 2024.  Since then, astronomers and aficionados have worked to refine our estimates of its orbit, specifically to determine the likelihood it will slam into the Earth a few years down the road.  It may be big enough to take out a whole city.  Or a whole nation.  It may have a 0% chance of hitting us, or a 5% chance.

The latest estimate is that there's around a 0% chance it will hit us, but the news successfully put asteroid defense into the public imagination.

Currently, astronomers and asteroid hunters think we've found less than half the asteroids that cross the Earth's orbit - "Near Earth Objects", or NEOs.  While calculating probabilities Asteroid 2024 YR4 will hit us, did the one that has a 75% chance of hitting us go undetected?

Diane Sare, oft time candidate for Senate in New Jersey, suggested to me and a few others that we should convene a few symposia to discuss what should be done about this asteroid threat.  She specifically suggested this could become a real project that draws all the great national powers together and lays the foundations for a lasting peace.

I had a bunch of thoughts about how to cast the issue in a novel way, and decided, instead of wasting an email on it, why not publish all my conspiracy theories online for all to see?

The thesis here is the following:  Man does not "be fruitful and multiply" by shooting, pushing, or exploding things.  Man survives and grows by making discoveries, and with these discoveries, increasing our power over the universe.  This should be the true goal of any program for planetary defense.

So, buckle up.

## 1. Your senses are reliable liars

This may seem like an esoteric topic right out of a lame philosophy class, but it's important for what comes next.

Since at least Plato, philosophers have chewed on whether our senses give an accurate representation of the world outside our bodies.  For example, [Plato's Cave](LINK).  My first deep dive into this topic was through the writings of economist Lyndon LaRouche, who just died back in 2018.  So, it's been a long chew.

I think [LaRouche](https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2003/eirv30n27-20030711/eirv30n27-20030711_016-science_for_teachers_visualizing-lar.pdf) is right on the mark here.

For example, take your weight.  Yes, you have gotten fat, but that's a different issue.  When you weigh yourself, you learn how much you weigh by looking at which number is indicated on the scale's display.  The display is sometimes an arrow that points at numbers written on a kind of ruler, or sometimes it's a digital monitor that just shows the numbers.

Either way, your _weight_ does not look like the _numbers_ on the scale.  Your weight is a complex interaction between the Earth and your body, mediated through what we call gravity.  Gravity, also, does not look like numbers, or an arrow, or the scale itself.

That scale is just like the rest of your senses, like your sense of sight.  You think you're seeing something outside your body right now, as you read this article.  But you're not.  Your brain is generating a pattern that your mind reads as an image.  That pattern is a response to what's happening on your retinas, in your eyes.  Light from the computer screen has propagated to the surface of your eyeballs, through your lenses - where the image gets flipped upside down - and then meets your retinas.  The structures on your retinas (pigments, "rods and cones") then send _electric_ signals into your optic nerves.  Those signals then get translated into _chemical_ motions through those nerves up into your brain.  The _electrochemical_ signals then get translated again into patterns within your brain.

Those patterns are very much _not_ the same thing as the computer screen.

All of your senses are really just instrumentation to translate signals from outside your body into signals in your brain.  For all you know, all the things you think are happening outside your body are really just things your sense perceptions are doing.  How do you even know there _is_ an "outside" of your body?  You're really only perceiving your body's sense surfaces and interpreting those!

## 2. Gauss was Perturbed

After Carl Gauss discovered the orbit of the first asteroid, Ceres, astronomers found it to be just about exactly where Gauss had predicted.  Thus ensued a flurry of renewed observations of the new cosmic wanderer, the which were used to further refine its orbital elements.

As part of this bustle of activity, European astronomers sought collaboration with young Gauss, and his written correspondence quickly grew voluminous.  Besides discovering more asteroids and calculating their orbits, Gauss's primary concern in these correspondences was to obtain observations that indicate deviations from perfectly elliptical orbits.  These are the _perturbations_.

Perturbations are typically described as nudges and tugs exerted by close encounters with larger planetary objects - specifically Jupiter, in the case of the early asteroids.  From what little I've read of this correspondence, as well as Gauss's own celestial mechanics textbook, Gauss publicly subscribed to this description.

However, it is well known that, especially early on in the reign of the French Revulsion's Napoleon, Gauss guarded his true thoughts with a zeal verging on paranoia.  Exhibit: Gauss waited almost a decade to reveal his original method to calculate the orbit of Ceres.

I suspect that Gauss had other obsessions that drove his interest in the planetary perturbations.  Besides the incredible opportunity for continental networking the research provided, of course.

Below are some ideas of what I think Gauss hoped to find.  And which I think should form part of a research program included under the rubric of Planetary Defense.

## 3. Elliptical Functions

The last published chapter of Gauss's _Disquisitiones Arithmetica_ suggested an extension of his circle division program into elliptical functions.  Gauss hinted at this extended investigation when he indicated his method could also be used to understand the nature of the lemniscate function.

Indeed, a look at his unpublished _Tagebuch_ proves that Gauss was obsessed with elliptical functions from an early age, and had already captured the essential principles by age 30.

Many years later, Niels Abel would send his manuscript on elliptical functions to Jean-Pierre Cauchy, who promptly buried the masterpiece until Abel's body was safely buried with the worms back in Norway.  In the paper, Abel showed how to extend Gauss's methods to other elliptic functions.  Abel also indicated that his researches uncovered a vast realm of new transcendental functions of which the elliptics form only a small subset.

Gauss knew that mathematics was not the nerdy flashing around of new combinations of symbols.  Rather, mathematics was an evolving language mankind has been crafting, that describes the interaction between universal principles and human creativity.

In other words, mathematics doesn't start with assumptions.  Mathematics starts with physics.  Cue Gauss's mythical smile at the end of his student Riemann's defense of his dissertation on the foundations of geometry.

## 4. Asteroids are tiny

A former collaborator of mine, Sky Jason Shields, once described to me why he was interested in embryology.  According to him, because the embryo was a veritable particle in the living field, it would be extremely sensitive to anomalies in that field.  In other words, the embryo (and the virus, another of Sky's "living particles") was an ideal test subject to study, in order to learn more about [biological spacetime](LINK vernadsky) in general.  It was like using iron filings to study the magnetic field.

Well, Asteroids are the veritable particles of planetary bodies, and thus the perfect sensitive instruments with which to probe the principles of universal gravitation.

Maybe Gauss thought something similar.  Kepler discovered that elliptical motion was captured in the natural world by planets that orbit the Sun.  Perhaps mathematics, specifically the study of elliptical functions, could be informed by physics, in this case planetary motion.

Gauss could have believed that our understanding of elliptical functions would be advanced by hunting for the anomalies in elliptical motions revealed by the motions of the asteroids.

In this case, it was not so clear that the deviations from elliptical motion were being caused by by pushes and pulls by other planets.  Maybe there was no effect generated by invisible forces at all.  An alternative would be that the asteroids were simply more sensitive to subtle to deviations from a perfect ellipse made by the true orbital path.  In other words, the ellipse could be a first order approximation to the true orbital path.  To discover higher order approximations (think "harmonics), study the slight deviations made by the asteroids.

What we do know - at least those of us that haven't read all Gauss's notes or correspondence - is that the final product of Gauss's interest in planetary purturbations was a strange 1819 paper on the orbit of asteroid Pallas.  In this paper, Gauss shows that the secular variations in the elliptical orbit of Pallas, ostensibly caused by the passing of Jupiter, are independent of the positions of either Pallas or Jupiter.  The secular varations are dependent on the properties of the orbits themselves.  He showed that you can reproduce those variations by distributing the mass of the asteroid continuously around its orbit, with density proportional to orbital speed (or, distance from the Sun).

In other words, the driving principle is the orbit, not the object floating around along that orbit.

## Conclusion

There have been many advances since Gauss's last breath on elliptical orbits in 1819.  For example, Albert Einstein recast our understanding of gravity as an interconnected interaction between mass, space, and time, which is measured as changes in curvature of many-dimensioned surfaces.

That said, a revived collaboration between the United States, Russia, China, and India toward a Strategic Defense of Earth should have a major focus on understanding orbits as a principle.  A good start would be to review Gauss's thinking on this topic, and assume new discoveries in the future that make Mankind more powerful.  Not just powerful enough to blow up or move asteroids, but to affect the orbital dynamics of the system as a whole.
