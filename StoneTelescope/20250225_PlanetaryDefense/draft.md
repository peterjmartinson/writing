How Carl Gauss Will Save Us From Extinction
===========================================

News has been ablaze recently with impending catastrophe.  A juggernaut is coming straight for us, all of us.  And unless we act now, we have no hope of survival.

No, we're not talking about President Trump here.  We're talking about an asteroid.

Asteroid <note NAME> was discovered during late 2024.  Since then, astronomers and afficcionados have worked to refine our estimates of its orbit, specifically to determine the likelihood it will slam into the Earth a few years down the road.  It may be big enough to take out a whole city.  Or a whole nation.  It may have a 0% chance of hitting us, or a 5% chance.

The latest estimate is that there's around a 0% chance it will hit us, but the news successfully put asteroid defense into the public imagination.

Currently, astronomers and asteroid hunters think we've found less than half the asteroids that cross the Earth's orbit - "Near Earth Objects", or NEOs.  While calculating probabilities Asteroid <note NAME> will hit us, did we miss the one that has a 75% chance of hitting us?

Diane Sare, oft time candidate for Senate in New Jersey, suggested to me and a few others that we should convene a few symposia to discuss what should be done about this asteroid threat.  She specifically suggested this could become a real project that draws all the great national powers together and lays the foundations for a lasting peace.

I had a bunch of thoughts about how to cast the issue in a novel way, and decided, instead of wasting an email on it, why not publish all my conspiracy theories online for all to see?

So, buckle up.

## Asteroids perturbed mathematician Carl Gauss

Gauss discovered the orbit of the first asteroid, Ceres, right at the dawn of the 19th Century.  The object had been spotted less than a year earlier, and astronomers around Europe scrambled to determine its orbit.  There were two concerns here - 1. without an accurate orbit, we might not be able to find Ceres again, and 2. whoever determined the orbit would win instant fame.

Then, almost out of nowhere, Gauss published his orbit in _Crelle's Journal_.  The European science community was stunned.  When Ceres was spotted again, exactly as predicted by 24 year old Gauss, the European science community exploded with excitement.

Gauss soon became innundated with correspondence, some containing accolades, some containing invitations, and some containing requests for collaboration.  Instead of telling people how he figured out the orbit, Gauss was already excited about the next step.
