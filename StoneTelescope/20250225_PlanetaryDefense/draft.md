How Carl Gauss Will Save Us From Extinction
===========================================

News has been ablaze recently with impending catastrophe.  A juggernaut is coming straight for us, all of us.  And unless we act now, we have no hope of survival.

No, we're not talking about President Trump here.  We're talking about an asteroid.

Asteroid <note NAME> was discovered during late 2024.  Since then, astronomers and afficcionados have worked to refine our estimates of its orbit, specifically to determine the likelihood it will slam into the Earth a few years down the road.  It may be big enough to take out a whole city.  Or a whole nation.  It may have a 0% chance of hitting us, or a 5% chance.

The latest estimate is that there's around a 0% chance it will hit us, but the news successfully put asteroid defense into the public imagination.

Currently, astronomers and asteroid hunters think we've found less than half the asteroids that cross the Earth's orbit - "Near Earth Objects", or NEOs.  While calculating probabilities Asteroid <note NAME> will hit us, did we miss the one that has a 75% chance of hitting us?

Diane Sare, oft time candidate for Senate in New Jersey, suggested to me and a few others that we should convene a few symposia to discuss what should be done about this asteroid threat.  She specifically suggested this could become a real project that draws all the great national powers together and lays the foundations for a lasting peace.

I had a bunch of thoughts about how to cast the issue in a novel way, and decided, instead of wasting an email on it, why not publish all my conspiracy theories online for all to see?

So, buckle up.

## 1. Your senses are reliable liars

This may seem like an esoteric topic right out of a lame philosophy class, but it's important for what comes next.

Since at least Plato, philosophers have chewed on whether our senses give an accurate representation of the world outside our bodies.  For example, [Plato's Cave](LINK).  My first deep dive into this topic was through the writings of economist Lyndon LaRouche, who just died back in 2018.  So, it's been a long chew.

I think [LaRouche](LINK sensorium article) is right on the mark here.

For example, take your weight.  Yes, you are fat, but that's a different issue.  When you weigh yourself, you learn how much you weigh by looking at which number is indicated on the scale's display.  The display is sometimes an arrow that points at numbers written on a kind of ruler, or sometimes it's a digital monitor that just shows the numbers.

Either way, your _weight_ does not look like the _numbers_ on the scale.  Your weight is a complex interaction between the Earth and your body, mediated through what we call gravity.  Gravity, also, does not look like numbers, or an arrow, or the scale itself.

That scale is just like the rest of your senses.  You think you're seeing something outside your body right now, as you read this article.  But you're not.  Your brain is generating a pattern that your mind reads as an image.  That pattern is a response to what's happening on your retinas, in your eyes.  Light from the computer screen has propagated to the surface of your eyeballs, through your lenses - where the image gets flipped upside down - and then meets your retinas.  The structures on your retinas (pigments) then send _electric_ signals into your optic nerves.  Those signals then get translated into _chemical_ motions through those nerves up into your brain.  The _electrochemical_ signals then get translated again into patterns within your brain.

Those patterns are very much _not_ the same thing as the computer screen.

All of your senses are really just instrumentation to translate signals from outside your body into signals in your brain.  For all you know, all the things you think are happening outside your body are really just things your sense perceptions are doing.  How do you even know there's something outside your body?  You're really only perceiving your body's sense surfaces and interpreting those!

## 2. Orbits


## Asteroids perturbed mathematician Carl Gauss

Gauss discovered the orbit of the first asteroid, Ceres, right at the dawn of the 19th Century.  The object had been spotted less than a year earlier, and astronomers around Europe scrambled to determine its orbit.  There were two concerns here - 1. without an accurate orbit, we might not be able to find Ceres again, and 2. whoever determined the orbit would win instant fame.

Then, almost out of nowhere, Gauss published his orbit in _Crelle's Journal_.  The European science community was stunned.  When Ceres was spotted again, exactly as predicted by 24 year old Gauss, the European science community exploded with excitement.

Gauss soon became innundated with correspondence, some containing accolades, some containing invitations, and some containing requests for collaboration.  Instead of telling people how he figured out the orbit, Gauss was already excited about the next step.
